The idea here is to demonstrate headless execution.

Ideally, doing a research you can crontab and run by night, to wake up with new content :)

The idea is to:
1. have a working prototype that works for me (WIP - 70% done).
2. DRY it completely of myself, so people can just change ONE file (`RICCARDO.MD` -> `GENEVIEVE.MD`) and it will still work.
