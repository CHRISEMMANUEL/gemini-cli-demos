Generate a story in Italian about little Sebastian (Seby) who wants to become a Tram driver in
Zurich; the story should mention Paradeplatz, a giraffe and the tram number 7 (his favorite). Make it fun and abstract!

* The story should last 3-4 minutes.
* Save the story in a properly named folder, like "YYYYMMDD_cuj01_(title_of_the_story)".
* Save the story in Italian, English and German, in 3 different Markdown files. Use _it _en _de in naming resources.
* Then create an audio track for each of these.

Do NOT ask me question, just go for as long as you can. If you encounter any errors, put them in a ERRORS.md file.
