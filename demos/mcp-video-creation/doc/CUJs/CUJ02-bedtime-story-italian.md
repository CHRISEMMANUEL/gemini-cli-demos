# 1. Nighttime story audio

Write me a bedtime story, and then use a Chirp 3 HD voice to read it.
Use any Italian voice (a random voice from list_chirp_voices(it_IT), possibly female).
In doubt, "it-IT-Chirp3-HD-Achernar" is awesome
Save the audio file locally and name it appropriately.

* Use a folder with name like `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-CUJ02-title-of-story/`.
* It should last around 90-120 seconds at most.

## Storyboard

Now lets create a storyboard for this bedtime story and then a video from it.
