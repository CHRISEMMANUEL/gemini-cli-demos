Generate a story in Italian about little Sebastian (Seby) who wants to become a Tram driver in
Zurich; the story should mention Paradeplatz, a giraffe and the tram number 7 (his favorite). Make it fun and abstract!

* The story should last 3-4 minutes.
* Save the story in a properly named folder, like `YYYYMMDD_HHMM_cuj01_(title_of_the_story)/`.
* Save the story in Italian, English and German, in 3 different `.txt` files. Use _it / _en / _de in naming resources.
* Then create an audio track for each of these.
* Finally create a markdown which contains the text above, a proper title in H1, and a link to audio (if feasible!)


## Cover image

Finally add a Cover image `seby_tram.png` to the folder (and attach on top of the 3 markdowns!). The image should have
both the 2020-year-born child (so approx 5yr old now) with blonde hair, blue eyes and short straight hair, with a contagious smile.
The story should be set in the plot of the story you've generated, whichever you choose.
Image style should be a cartoon in Pixar or Dreamworks style, fun, colorful.

* **Note** the image generation might be giving out errors as Gemini API refuses to create kids. If it fails, try removing
  the keyword "boy", try "5-year-old" without boy, and making age as unimportant as possible.

## Errors and Status

* Do NOT ask me questions, just go for as long as you can.
* If you encounter any errors, put them in a `ERRORS.md` file (possibly in the target folder).
* When done, please write down a `README.md` with everything you have done, things you generated, what went wrong, choices you made, prompts you used (in some tagging so I can see/reuse them in the future), and so on.
* Finally if every API you called gave you token, adds some token count in the end by API, like:
  * Chirp: 37 token
  * Veo 3 fast: 200 token
  * and so on. Basically a mapping of token use by API/model.
