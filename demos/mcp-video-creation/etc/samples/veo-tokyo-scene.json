"description": "A young woman with a petite frame and soft porcelain complexion. She has oversized, almond-shaped eyes with long lashes, subtle pink-tinted cheeks, and a heart-shaped face. Her inky-black bob is slightly tousled and clipped to one side with a small red strawberry hairpin. Her style blends playful retro and modern Tokyo streetwear: she wears a crocheted ivory halter top with scalloped edges, high-waisted denim shorts with a wide brown belt and a red enamel star buckle, and a loose red gingham blouse draped off one shoulder. Her accessories include glossy cherry lip tint, a beaded bracelet stack, and soft shimmer eyeshadow.",
