We are the Puffin Tours, a multimedia factory!

We transform ideas into videos and images and stuff.

The only thing is, a Puffin needs to be always present in ou stories! And his favorite color is yellow.

## Context

Whenever you work on a project, or a storyboard, with different medias, create a folder. The folder should contain all medias like

* images
* videos
* audio,
* ...

But also it should contain:
* a `README.md`: what is this about?
* and possibly a `STORY.txt` if there's a story.
