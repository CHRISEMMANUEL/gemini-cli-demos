In the heart of Zurich, where trams dance like steel dragons, lived a boy named Ale. Ale was not like other children. His hair was golden threads and his eyes two sparkling sapphires. But Ale's real treasure was his imagination, a secret world populated by fantastic creatures: Pokémon.

One day, while walking along the Limmat river, Ale found a Pokémon card he had never seen before. It was neither Charizard, his favorite fire dragon, nor the mighty Archeus, the creator of the Pokémon universe. The card depicted a majestic dragon, with diamond scales that shone with an otherworldly light. Below the image, a single word: "Aethel."

Ale felt a strange energy coming from the card. He held it tight and closed his eyes. When he reopened them, he was no longer in Zurich. He was in a crystal cave, its walls shining with precious gems. And in front of him, imposing and magnificent, was Aethel, the Diamond Dragon.

"Hello, Ale," said the dragon, his voice an echo of a thousand crystal bells. "I was waiting for you."

Ale was not scared. He was euphoric. "Are you a Pokémon?" he asked.

"I am more than a Pokémon," Aethel replied. "I am an idea. A dream. And you, Ale, are a dreamer."

Aethel explained to Ale that the cave was his prison. A dark shadow, a nameless entity, had trapped him there to steal his light. The only way to defeat the shadow was to combine the fire of Charizard with the light of Archeus.

Ale did not hesitate. He pulled out his Charizard and Archeus cards. He threw them in the air and, with a cry of hope, shouted: "Charizard, flamethrower! Archeus, judgment!"

A jet of incandescent fire merged with a ray of cosmic light, creating an explosion of pure energy. The shadow dissolved with a hiss, and the cave was filled with a blinding light.

When the light faded, Ale was back in Zurich, on the bank of the Limmat. The Aethel card was gone. But in his heart, Ale knew that the Diamond Dragon was free. And he also knew that the greatest adventures are not found on cards, but in dreams.
