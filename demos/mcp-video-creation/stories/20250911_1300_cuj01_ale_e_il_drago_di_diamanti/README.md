## Process

1.  A directory was created for the story.
2.  The story was written in Italian.
3.  The story was translated into English and German.
4.  The stories were saved as markdown files.
5.  Audio was generated for each story using the `chirp_tts` tool.
6.  Cover images were generated using the `imagen_t2i` tool.
7.  Music for each scene was generated using the `lyria_generate_music` tool.
8.  Videos for each scene were generated using the `veo_i2v` and `veo_t2v` tools.

## Failures

*   **Video Generation**: The video generation process was fraught with difficulties. Many attempts failed due to safety filters and issues with the input images. The `veo_i2v` tool failed to generate videos for scenes 1 and 2, so `veo_t2v` was used instead.
*   **Audio/Video Combination**: The `ffmpeg_combine_audio_and_video` tool was not available, and the `ffmpeg` command was not found in the system's PATH. Therefore, the audio and video could not be combined.
