# Storyboard: Dev Fest Modena 2025 Pitch

## Scene 1: The Maestro of Modena

**Context:** An establishing shot of Modena's beautiful Piazza Grande. A famous tenor singer, reminiscent of Pavarotti, stands center stage, warming up his voice with powerful notes. The atmosphere is grand and classically Italian.

## Scene 2: The Google Developers Army

**Prompt:** A fast-paced montage of diverse developers in Google-colored t-shirts coding. Animated Google logos pop up and disappear. The style is modern, dynamic, and energetic.

## Scene 3: The Balsamic Glitch

**Context:** A comical, slow-motion shot. A bottle of traditional Modena balsamic vinegar is dramatically poured over a sleek, modern laptop. Instead of causing damage, the screen flickers and then displays the "Dev Fest Modena" logo in a glitchy, stylized way.

## Scene 4: The Tech Crescendo

**Prompt:** A tenor singer hits a high note in a modern conference room, surrounded by cheering developers in Google-colored t-shirts holding up laptops displaying glowing Google logos.

## Scene 5: Join the Celebration!
