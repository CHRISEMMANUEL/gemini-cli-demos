Once upon a time in Zurich, there was a little boy named Seby, who had a dream as big as a Swiss mountain: to become a tram driver! His favorite tram was the number 7, yellow and rattling, which he called "the smiling serpent."

One day, while waiting for the 7 at Paradeplatz with his mom, Seby saw something incredible. Instead of the usual man with the hat, driving the tram there was... a giraffe! Yes, a very tall giraffe, with a neck so long that it stuck out of the tram's roof and tickled the clouds.

"Mom, look! A giraffe driver!" shouted Seby, pointing with his little finger. People laughed, thinking it was just a child's imagination. But when the tram stopped, the giraffe leaned out and said in a deep, gentle voice: "Tickets, please! And a sprig of acacia for me, if possible."

Seby didn't need to be told twice. He ran home, took his toy watering can, and filled it with lettuce leaves (he didn't have any acacia, but he thought it would be fine). He rushed back to Paradeplatz, just in time to see the number 7 tram leaving.

"Wait! I have your leaves!" shouted Seby. The giraffe braked suddenly, making all the tram's bells ring like a Christmas song. It stretched out its long neck, gently took the watering can, and munched on the lettuce.

"Mmmh, delicious! Thank you, little driver," said the giraffe. "To thank you, would you like to take a ride with me?"

Seby's eyes lit up like Christmas lights. He climbed aboard and the giraffe showed him all the buttons and levers. Together, they drove the number 7 tram all over Zurich, waving to passersby, ringing the bell to the rhythm of music, and being careful not to bump into the stars, which that evening seemed lower than usual.

From that day on, every time Seby takes the number 7 tram, he always checks who is driving. And even though he never saw his giraffe friend again, he knows that somewhere, in a Zurich full of magic, there is a tram driven by a very, very special driver. And every now and then, he leaves a little lettuce on the driver's seat, just in case.
