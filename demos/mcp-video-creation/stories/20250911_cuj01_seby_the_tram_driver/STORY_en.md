Once upon a time, in a Zurich full of sunshine and chocolate, there was a little boy named Seby who had a dream as big as a mountain: to become a tram driver. But not just any tram! His heart beat only for tram number 7, the bright yellow one that zipped through the city like lightning.

One afternoon, while Seby was on his beloved tram 7, he fell asleep, lulled by the gentle rocking. When he opened his eyes, he noticed that something had changed. In the driver's seat, there was a very tall giraffe wearing a captain's hat! The giraffe winked at him and said, 'Welcome aboard the Tram of Dreams, Seby! Fasten your seatbelt, we're off on an adventure!'

Tram 7 lifted off the ground and began to fly over the rooftops of Zurich. They passed over Paradeplatz, which had turned into a giant chessboard where bankers in suits and ties played chess with pieces as big as cars. 'Checkmate!' shouted the giraffe, as the tram did a pirouette in the air.

Then, the tram dived into the Limmat river, which was no longer made of water, but of melted chocolate! Marzipan fish swam lazily, and the ducks bathed in the chocolate with delight. Seby laughed his head off as the tram sailed through the chocolate waves.

Finally, the giraffe-driver brought tram 7 back to Seby's stop. 'Remember, Seby,' the giraffe told him, 'dreams are like trams: if you wait for them, sooner or later they will take you where you want to go.' Seby got off the tram, and when he turned around, the giraffe was gone. In its place was the usual driver, who smiled at him.

From that day on, Seby knew for sure that one day he would drive tram number 7. And every time he saw a giraffe at the zoo, he would wink at it, knowing that dreams, sometimes, are just a tram ride away.
