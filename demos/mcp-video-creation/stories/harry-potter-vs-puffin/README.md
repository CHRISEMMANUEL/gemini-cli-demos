## Video Prompt
The current video for the wizard is not satisfactory as the wizard does not resemble Harry Potter. For future video generation, please use a prompt that specifically describes Harry Potter, and consider using Imagen 4 Ultra for generating the wizard image to ensure better likeness and quality.

## Video Generation Prompt (Current)
Harry the Wizard and a puffin flying together over the city of Rome, with iconic Roman landmarks in the background.
