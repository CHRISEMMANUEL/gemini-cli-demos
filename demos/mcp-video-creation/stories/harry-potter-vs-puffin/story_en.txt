Harry Potter was on vacation in Rome. He was eating a delicious gelato near the Colosseum when a puffin swooped down and snatched his wand. "Hey!" shouted Harry. The puffin, holding the wand in its beak, just winked. Harry chased the puffin all over Rome. They flew past the Pantheon, zoomed around the Trevi Fountain, and even startled the pigeons in St. Peter's Square. The puffin was fast, but Harry was a great flyer. Finally, over the Tiber river, Harry cast a non-verbal spell, "Accio wand!". The wand flew out of the puffin's beak and back into Harry's hand. The puffin squawked, as if to say "Well played!", and flew away. Harry, tired but triumphant, went back to his gelato.
