# Seby, the Dream Tram Driver

Once upon a time, in a very colorful Zurich, there was a little boy named Seby. Seby was five years old, with hair as blond as the sun and a smile that made flowers bloom even in winter. But Seby had a big, big dream: he wanted to become a tram driver. Not just any tram, but his favorite, number 7, the bright yellow one that cheerfully rattled through the city streets.

One morning, Seby woke up and realized that his bed was no longer a bed. It had become a tram! And not just any tram, but the number 7! His bedroom had transformed into a Paradeplatz made of Lego bricks and plush toys. "All aboard!" shouted Seby, pulling an imaginary cord that rang a chocolate bell.

The tram set off, not on the usual tracks, but on a rainbow of gummy candies. They crossed rivers of orange juice and mountains of whipped cream. At Paradeplatz, a giraffe with a colorful striped scarf and a top hat was waiting at the stop. "Mr. Driver," said the giraffe in a deep, gentle voice, "could you take me to the zoo? I have an appointment for tea with the flamingos."

Seby smiled. "Of course, Mrs. Giraffe! But today my tram is taking a special detour!" And with a flick of a lever, tram number 7 took flight, leaving the candy Zurich behind to soar up into the sky. They flew among clouds of cotton candy and stars of anise. The giraffe, with her long neck, could almost touch the moon, which that morning was a butter cookie.

"Look!" said Seby, pointing to a castle made of marshmallows. "That's where the king of dreams lives!" The giraffe was speechless, amazed by this fantastic world. They had a picnic on a cloud, eating cloud sandwiches and drinking lemonade rain.

When it was time to go back, the tram descended gently, landing right in front of the zoo. "Thank you for this unforgettable journey, little driver," said the giraffe, getting off the tram. "It was much better than tea with the flamingos!"

Seby waved goodbye to his new friend and set off again. His bed-tram took him back to his room, just as his mom came in to wake him up. "Good morning, sweetie! Did you sleep well?"

Seby opened his eyes and saw the sun streaming through the window. In his bed, clutched in his hands, was his favorite model: a small yellow tram, number 7. He smiled. He knew that one day, not too far away, he would drive a real tram. And maybe, every now and then, he would take a little detour through the clouds.
