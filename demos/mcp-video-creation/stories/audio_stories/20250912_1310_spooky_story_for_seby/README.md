## Prompts Used

### Imagen Prompt (that worked)

```
A young man with blonde hair, blue eyes, and short straight hair, with a contagious smile, is on a spooky, ghostly tram in Zurich at night. He is holding a small giraffe plushie. The tram is old and grey, glowing with a faint, ghostly light. The style should be a fun and colorful cartoon, like Pixar or Dreamworks.
