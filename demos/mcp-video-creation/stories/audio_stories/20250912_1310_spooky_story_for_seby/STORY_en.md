# The Ghostly Tram of Zurich

![Seby and the Ghostly Tram](seby.png)

One foggy night in Zurich, a little boy named Seby and his favorite giraffe, Rara, were waiting for the last tram home. A thick fog rolled through the streets, making everything look mysterious and spooky.

Suddenly, they heard a faint "ding-ding" in the distance. A tram was coming, but it wasn't one of the bright blue and white trams Seby was used to. This one was old and grey, and it seemed to glow with a faint, ghostly light.

The tram pulled up to the stop with a soft hiss. The doors creaked open, and a friendly-looking man in an old-fashioned uniform smiled at them. "Welcome aboard the Ghostly Tram," he said in a gentle voice. "I'm Casper, the driver."

Seby, holding Rara tight, wasn't scared at all. He was excited! He had never been on a ghost tram before. They climbed aboard and found a cozy seat by the window.

As the tram glided silently through the foggy streets, Casper told them his story. "I've been driving this tram for a hundred years," he said, "always hoping to make a new friend."

Seby and Rara listened with wide eyes. They weren't scared of Casper. They thought he was the friendliest ghost they had ever met. They chatted and laughed with him for the whole ride, telling him all about their adventures in Zurich.

When they reached their stop, Seby and Rara waved goodbye to their new friend. "Thank you for the ride, Casper!" Seby shouted.

Casper smiled, a warm, ghostly tear in his eye. "No, thank you, Seby and Rara," he said. "I'm not a lonely ghost anymore."

As the Ghostly Tram disappeared into the fog, Seby and Rara headed home, their hearts full of a happy, spooky warmth. That night, they dreamed of their new friend, the friendly ghost tram driver of Zurich.
