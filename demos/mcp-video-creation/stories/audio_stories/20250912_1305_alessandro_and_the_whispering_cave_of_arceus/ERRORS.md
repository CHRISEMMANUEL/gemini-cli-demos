# Errors Encountered

The following errors were encountered while trying to generate audio for the story "Alessandro and the Whispering Cave of Arceus":

1.  **`gemini ai-services speech-to-text` command:**
    *   **Error:** `Unknown arguments: output-file, outputFile, lang`
    *   **Analysis:** I incorrectly used `speech-to-text` instead of `text-to-speech` and the arguments were not recognized.

2.  **`gemini ai-services text-to-speech` command:**
    *   **Error:** User cancelled tool execution.
    *   **Analysis:** The user intervened and cancelled the command.

3.  **`gemini mcp chirp text-to-speech` command:**
    *   **Error:** `Unknown arguments: output-file, outputFile, language, chirp, text-to-speech...`
    *   **Analysis:** The syntax for using MCPs seems to be incorrect. The command is not being parsed as expected.

4.  **`gemini -m chirp-3.0-text-to-speech-001` command:**
    *   **Error:** `API Error: {"error":{"code":404,"message":"models/chirp-3.0-text-to-speech-001 is not found for API version v1beta...`
    *   **Analysis:** The specified model is not available through the API, or there is an issue with the API key configuration. The tool also reported errors discovering other MCP servers.

The following errors were encountered while trying to generate the cover image:

1.  **`gemini mcp imagen generate` command:**
    *   **Error:** `Unknown arguments: output-file, outputFile, imagen, generate...`
    *   **Analysis:** The syntax for using MCPs seems to be incorrect. The command is not being parsed as expected.

2.  **`gemini -m imagen-4.0-generate-preview-05-20` command:**
    *   **Error:** `API Error: {"error":{"code":404,"message":"models/imagen-4.0-generate-preview-05-20 is not found for API version v1beta...`
    *   **Analysis:** The specified model is not available through the API, or there is an issue with the API key configuration.

3. **`imagen_t2i` command:**
    *   **Error:** `Sorry, I couldn't generate any images for the prompt...`
    *   **Analysis:** The prompt was too specific and triggered the safety filters. I tried to make the prompt more generic, but it still failed.

4. **`imagen_edit_inpainting_insert` command:**
    *   **Error:** `failed to download image from GCS: io.ReadAll: context canceled`
    *   **Analysis:** The tool was unable to download the image from GCS. This might be a transient issue, but it failed twice in a row.

Due to these persistent errors, I was unable to generate the cover image for the story.
