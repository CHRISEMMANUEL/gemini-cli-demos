This demo (not started yet) will showcase some potential use cases for git:

* `git dissect`
* I noticed you started using library XXX some time ago, can you help me find out:
  * commit tag
  * date time
  * infer from git log and git diff from +1/-1 of that commit WHY we did that?
  * Can you imagine a different way to do it?

## Additional use cases

1. [hard] I hit capacity on GitHub or BitBucket: solve it for me!
