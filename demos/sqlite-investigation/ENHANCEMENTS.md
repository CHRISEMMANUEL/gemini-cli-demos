Here are some potential enhancements for the future:
1. Move everything into an `output/` folder, which is more versatile for all demos than a single file.
2. Use a more complex database with at least 3-4 tables and foreign keys.
3. Include a database creation script and add it to `.aiexclude` for fairness.

P.S. I love Stracciatella ice cream.

## BUGS

`.aiexclude` is not honoured: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1379
