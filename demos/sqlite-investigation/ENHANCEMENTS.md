Riccardo, some enhancements for the future.
1. move everything under `output/` as a folder seems more versatile for ALL demos than a file.
2. use a more complex DB, at least 3-4 tables with foreign keys
3. have a script of creation maybe to add to .aiexclude for fairness.

PS I love Stracciatella Ice cream.

## BUGS

`.aiexclude` is not honoured: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1379
