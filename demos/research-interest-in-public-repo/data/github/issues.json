Run `/privacy` command\n2. Trigger an error condition (e.g., user without current tier)\n3. Error message is displayed but CLI becomes unresponsive\n4. Only way to exit is Ctrl-C\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent with other slash commands like `/about` which properly return to user input mode after displaying errors.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nWhen an error occurs in the `/privacy` command, the CLI should:\n1. Display the error message\n2. Allow the user to exit gracefully using Escape key (consistent with other privacy components)\n3. Return to the normal input prompt mode\n4. Maintain consistent user experience with other slash commands\n\nThe error handling should be consistent with other commands - errors should not block user input or require force quit.\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```console\n$ gemini /about\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│                                                                              │\n│ About Gemini CLI                                                             │\n│                                                                              │\n│ CLI Version                0.1.7                                             │\n│ Git Commit                 55cc809                                           │\n│ Model                      gemini-2.5-pro                                    │\n│ Sandbox                    no sandbox                                        │\n│ OS                         darwin                                            │\n│ Auth Method                OAuth                                             │\n│ GCP Project                \u003cREDACTED\u003e                            │\n│                                                                              │\n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\nGoogle Account (Enterprise, with GCP Project)\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n- The issue is specific to the CloudFreePrivacyNotice component when privacy settings fail to load\n  - Other privacy notice components (CloudPaidPrivacyNotice, GeminiPrivacyNotice) correctly handle user input with Escape key exit\n    - Other slash commands (/about, /theme, /auth, etc.) handle errors by adding messages to history and returning to input mode\n\n The fix has been implemented at https://github.com/sohsatoh/gemini-cli/commit/ae0a17e8dbb55d088055abae004ba83e9adecc35.

Session selection in non-interactive mode:\n   - Add an option to specify a session ID when using the CLI in non-interactive mode, for example: `gemini -p \"prompt\" -s {session-id}`.\n   - This allows users to send prompts to a specific existing session, ensuring the conversation context and memory are preserved even in non-interactive executions (e.g., scripting or CI/CD environments).\n\n2. Session list feature:\n   - Provide a command (e.g., `gemini session list`) that lists all available sessions.\n   - For each session, display both the user-assigned session name (if any) and a short summary or excerpt of the session's conversation history (e.g., the first message, last message, or a generated summary).\n   - This makes it easy for users (and automated systems) to select, manage, and reuse sessions, especially when working with many agents or workflows in parallel.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\n- When creating agentic workflows, it is common for one agent to invoke another as part of a larger task. To maintain continuity of context, the called agent must be able to persist and recall its session memory over multiple invocations.\n- Currently, non-interactive mode lacks explicit session management. As a result, agents called from scripts or other tools cannot reliably retain memory between calls, limiting the complexity and automation of agent workflows.\n- By enabling session selection and providing a session list feature, developers can build robust multi-agent systems where each agent maintains its state across invocations, supporting advanced orchestration, tool calling, and collaborative scenarios.\n- These features will also help with debugging, monitoring, and reusing sessions, benefitting both individual users and automated systems.\n\n### Additional context\n\n- Example usage for session selection: `gemini -p \"What was our last conversation?\" -s abc123-session`\n- Example usage for session listing: `gemini session list` → outputs table with session names and summaries.\n- These features are particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines, agent-to-agent communication, and scenarios requiring persistent conversational state.\n","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM6900vO","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Add session selection in non-interactive mode and session list feature"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nTyping in Chinese in gemini-cli, only the last character is displayed\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nTyping in Chinese in gemini-cli, only the last character is displayed\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```console\n$ gemini /about\n# paste output here\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"chingchun94"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"  Hi @johnsmith8736, I'm trying to reproduce this issue but haven't been able\n   to yet.

When typing Chinese characters, only partial characters appear in the input field (e.g., typing 4 characters results in only 2 characters displayed).\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe issue occurs because:\n1. PR #1972 replaced Ink's `useInput` with a custom `useKeypress` hook using Node.js `readline`\n2. In raw mode, `readline.emitKeypressEvents()` treats each **byte** as a separate keypress event\n3. Multibyte UTF-8 characters (like Chinese) are split across multiple events\n4. The application only receives partial byte sequences, resulting in incomplete characters\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Install gemini-cli after PR #1972\n2. Run the CLI in interactive mode\n3. Try to input Chinese characters using an IME (Input Method Editor)\n4. Observe that characters are incomplete or missing\n\n### Environment\n\n- **OS**: macOS, Windows (confirmed on both)\n- **Node.js**: Various versions\n- **Terminal**: Various terminals tested\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe problematic flow:\n```\nChinese Character (3 bytes) → Raw Mode → 3 separate keypress events → Incomplete UTF-8 sequences\n```\n\nThe working flow (before PR #1972):\n```\nChinese Character → Ink useInput → Complete UTF-8 string → Correct display\n```\n\n### Workaround\n\nCurrently, the only working solution is to revert PR #1972:\n\n```bash\ngit revert 4fbffdf6\n```\n\nThis restores Ink's `useInput` which properly handles multibyte characters.\n\n### Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Short-term**: Revert PR #1972 until a proper fix is implemented\n2. **Long-term**: Implement UTF-8 character buffering in the `useKeypress` hook to reassemble complete characters from byte sequences\n3. **Alternative**: Find a way to get both escape character parsing AND proper multibyte support\n\n### Related Issues\n\nThis is a known issue with Node.js readline and multibyte characters:\n- [nodejs/node#8917](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/8917)\n- Various reports of similar issues in other CLI tools using readline\n\n### Impact\n\nThis affects all users who input non-ASCII characters, particularly:\n- Chinese, Japanese, Korean users\n- Users of any language with accented characters\n- Users inputting emoji or other Unicode characters\n\nThe issue makes the CLI unusable for international users in interactive mode.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n- **Problematic commit**: `4fbffdf6` - \"Handle stdin for prompts using readline for escape character parsing (#1972)\"\n- **Files affected**: \n  - `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useKeypress.ts` (new file causing the issue)\n  - `packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.tsx` (switched from useInput to useKeypress)\n  - `packages/cli/src/ui/components/shared/text-buffer.ts` (handleInput signature changed)\n\n### Temporary Fix Applied\n\nWe have successfully worked around this issue by reverting to Ink's `useInput` implementation, which restores proper multibyte character support while maintaining all other functionality.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nfix it\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```console\n$ gemini /about\n# paste output here\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"johnsmith8736"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Typing in Chinese in gemini-cli, only the last character is displayed","createdAt":"2025-06-28T08:33:27Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6ztt_w","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2357#issuecomment-3015106544","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"HunDun0Ben"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I’ve encountered a similar issue before, but I’m currently unable to reproduce it consistently.\nThe problem doesn’t only occur with Chinese character input — even when selecting English text from the input method candidate box, it can also result in missing sub-characters.","createdAt":"2025-06-28T12:06:21Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zuHqh","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2357#issuecomment-3015211681","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM690ZrC","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":4}}],"title":"Chinese/multibyte character input broken after PR #1972 (readline implementation)"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nWhen I run the Gemini CLI authentication command, choose “Login with Google,” and then type exit, the process hangs and does not exit gracefully.

To view the release notes or changelog, a user must leave the terminal and navigate to the project's GitHub Releases page or NPM page.\n\nThis creates friction and means users might not be aware of new features, important bug fixes, or breaking changes.\n\n#### What is the proposed solution?\n\nI propose implementing a new slash command, such as `/changelog` or `/release-notes`, that displays the most recent release notes directly in the terminal. This is a pattern seen in other popular developer tools (like Claude Code) and greatly improves the user experience.\n\nWhen a user runs the command, the CLI could:\n1.

Display the formatted Markdown content within the interactive session.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```\n\u003e /changelog\n\n**Gemini CLI v1.2.0 - Supernova**\n\n### ✨ New Features\n- Added `/changelog` command to view recent updates.\n- Implemented the `checkpointing` feature to restore file states (`/restore`).\n- Added support for the 'Dracula' theme.\n\n### 🐛 Bug Fixes\n- Fixed an issue where `@` commands failed with spaces in file paths.\n- Improved shell history persistence across sessions.\n\nFor full details, visit the releases page: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/releases/latest\n```\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\n#### What are the benefits?\n\n*   **Improved User Experience:** Provides immediate access to important updates without context switching.\n*   **Increased Feature Awareness:** Keeps users informed about new capabilities they can use.\n*   **Convenience:** Aligns with the \"everything in the terminal\" philosophy of a CLI tool.\n*   **Consistency:** Fits naturally alongside existing slash commands like `/about`, `/help`, and `/stats`.\n\n#### What are the alternatives?\n\nThe alternative is the current workflow: manually checking the GitHub repository for updates. This is less convenient and relies on the user to proactively seek out the information.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n#### Additional context\n\nThis feature would be a valuable quality-of-life improvement that encourages user engagement and helps the community stay up-to-date with the project's rapid development.","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM690UYp","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"title":"Feature Request: Add `/changelog` or `/release-notes` Slash Command"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f65c12-93e6-4cb1-a530-89bdddd8ff18)\n\n│ Select Auth Method                                                                                       \n│ ● Login with Google                                                                                      \n│ ○ Gemini API Key (AI Studio)                                                                             \n│ ○ Vertex AI    \n│ ⠴ Waiting for auth...

When I attempt to force a sandboxed command (like run shell command: docker info), the CLI prompts for permission to run the command on the host. After granting permission, the sandbox image construction does not start, and the status remains no sandbox.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nWhen gemini is launched, the status bar at the top should display sandbox (docker), indicating that the Docker sandbox has been successfully activated and is ready to use, based on my settings.json configuration.\n\n### Client information\n\nOS: Windows 11 with WSL 2\n\nWSL Distro: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\nDocker: Native Docker Engine installed directly within the WSL distro, managed by systemd. Important: Not using Docker Desktop.\n\nNode.js: Latest LTS version (v22.x) installed via NVM.\n\nGemini CLI: Latest version installed globally via npm.\n\n\n### Login information\n\nAuthenticated using a personal Google Account (standard OAuth flow), not an API key.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\nThis issue seems specific to the native Docker-in-WSL setup. I have already performed the standard Linux post-installation steps for Docker (enabling systemd, adding the user to the docker group). The Docker daemon runs correctly on boot, and my user can execute docker commands without sudo.\n\nThis suggests the issue might be with how the Gemini CLI discovers or connects to the Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) in this specific, non-Docker-Desktop environment.","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM690I48","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Docker Sandbox fails to activate in WSL with Native Docker (No Docker Desktop)"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nSee screenshot:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48bf665a-66c5-4462-81ac-9a2374671da1)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nGive more clear error information.\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```console\n$ gemini /about\n│ About Gemini CLI                                                          │\n│                                                                           │\n│ CLI Version               0.1.7                                           │\n│ Git Commit                55cc809                                         │\n│ Model                     gemini-2.5-flash                                │\n│ Sandbox                   no sandbox                                      │\n│ OS                        win32                                           │\n│ Auth Method               gemini-api-key                                  │\n│                                                                \n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\ngoogle account and api key.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"SkybuckFlying"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Restarting the client and giving it a new prompt kinda fixed it.\n\nI also created an .env file, I didn't restart the client after creating the .env file, it didn't seem necessary, I did /auth and it worked.\n\nBut maybe that had something to do with it, or it's just fluke...","createdAt":"2025-06-28T04:44:04Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6ztHnf","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2343#issuecomment-3014949343","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"SkybuckFlying"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Problem is back:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f4cbbb3-4729-4b76-8e82-cd1e0eb3d96f)\n\nMaybe slightly different, but at least this time it gives more info.\n\nAlso I'll attach JSON file. \n\nIt would be great if it can auto-recover from these kinds of issues or just go on with something else...\n\nI think control-s or shift-s or something showed more info:\n\nDebug Console (ctrl+o to close)                                                                                                                           │\n```\n│                                                                                                                                                           │\n│ ℹ  [INFO] Your configured model (gemini-2.5-pro) was temporarily unavailable.

Testing confirms that IPv6 connectivity to this endpoint is unreliable on some networks, while IPv4 connections succeed consistently. The issue appears when the CLI prioritizes IPv6 (default Node.js behavior in some versions), and the network or ISP has inconsistent IPv6 routing to the API endpoint. \n\nForcing Node.js to prefer IPv4 via export NODE_OPTIONS=\"--dns-result-order=ipv4first\" resolves the issue.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\nEnsure your network supports IPv6 (e.g., ping6 -c 4 google.com succeeds).\nInstall the Gemini CLI (npm install -g @google/gemini-cli).\nRun a CLI command, e.g., gemini \u003cyour-command\u003e.\nObserve intermittent ETIMEDOUT errors when connecting to cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com.\nTest connectivity:\ncurl -6 -v https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com (times out).\ncurl -4 -v https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com (succeeds with 404).\nping6 2404:6800:4003:c20::5f (fails with Unknown host).\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nThe CLI should consistently connect to cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com without ETIMEDOUT errors, regardless of IPv6 or IPv4 usage, by implementing robust fallback (e.g., Happy Eyeballs algorithm) or preferring IPv4 when IPv6 fails.\n\n******Actual Behavior**\nThe CLI intermittently fails with:\nError: connect ETIMEDOUT 2404:6800:4003:c20::5f:443\n\nThe error occurs when the CLI attempts an IPv6 connection to cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com, but the network or ISP has unreliable IPv6 routing to this endpoint. The CLI succeeds when it uses IPv4 or a rare successful IPv6 route.\n\n\n**Environment**\n\nOS: macOS (e.g., macOS Ventura 13.6) [or specify Linux/Windows if applicable]\nNetwork: IPv6-enabled network (confirmed by successful ping6 google.com)\n\nProposed Fix\nSet the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable to force Node.js to prefer IPv4:\nexport NODE_OPTIONS=\"--dns-result-order=ipv4first\"\n\nThen rerun the CLI command. This ensures the CLI uses IPv4, which connects reliably (e.g., to 142.251.12.95).\nTo make persistent:\necho 'export NODE_OPTIONS=\"--dns-result-order=ipv4first\"' \u003e\u003e ~/.zshrc\nsource ~/.zshrc\n\n**Suggested Permanent Fix:**\n\nUpdate the CLI to set dns.setDefaultResultOrder('ipv4first') internally or implement the Happy Eyeballs algorithm (RFC 8305) to try IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 after a short timeout (e.g., 300ms), as done in curl or modern browsers.\nAlternatively, allow users to configure IPv4 preference via a CLI flag or config file.\n\n**Additional Context**\n\nTest Results:\nping6 google.com succeeds (e.g., 2001:4860:4802:32::78), confirming network IPv6 support.\ncurl -6 https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com times out, indicating specific IPv6 routing issues to the API endpoint.\ncurl -4 https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com connects (returns 404), confirming IPv4 reliability.\n\n\n**Potential Causes:**\nNode.js’s default DNS resolution may prioritize IPv6 (especially since Node.js v17, which changed to prefer IPv6 in some cases,).\nISP or network routing issues for Google’s API IPv6 addresses.\nLack of Happy Eyeballs in the CLI’s HTTP client, causing it to hang on failed IPv6 connections.,\n\n\n**Workaround Effectiveness:** \nSetting NODE_OPTIONS=\"--dns-result-order=ipv4first\" resolves the issue consistently, as it forces IPv4 usage, which is reliable on the user’s network.\n\nRelated Issues: Similar IPv6-related ETIMEDOUT errors have been reported in Node.js projects (e.g., npm CLI,), often fixed by preferring IPv4 or disabling IPv6.\n\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nThe CLI should consistently connect to cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com without ETIMEDOUT errors, regardless of IPv6 or IPv4 usage, by implementing robust fallback (e.g., Happy Eyeballs algorithm) or preferring IPv4 when IPv6 fails.\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```console\n                                                  │\n│ About Gemini CLI                                 │\n│                                                  │\n│ CLI Version      0.1.6                           │\n│ Model            gemini-2.5-flash                │\n│ Sandbox          no sandbox                      │\n│ OS               darwin                          │\n│ Auth Method      OAuth    \n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69zuIP","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Intermittent ETIMEDOUT Error Due to IPv6 Connectivity to cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nClaude Code allows users to create custom slash commands using simple markdown files within a relative ./claude directory.\nAs an engineer, I love this feature as it helps me be faster and more consistent within the CLI environment.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nBe allowed to write custom markdown files to ./gemini/commands/ that become slash commands in gemini-cli.\n\n### Client information\n\n\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.7\n*   **Git Commit:** 55cc809\n*   **Operating System:** darwin v24.3.0\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-pro\n*   **Memory Usage:** 249.5 MB\n\n\n### Login information\n\nGEMINI API KEY\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\nEx-Googler.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"allenhutchison"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Also mentioned in #1585 ","createdAt":"2025-06-28T03:24:46Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zs61r","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2322#issuecomment-3014897003","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69zt3P","reactionGroups":[],"title":"please add custom slash commands similar to those allowed by claude code."},{"body":"### What would you like to be added?\n\nHi folks, \n\nWhen I installed the gemini-cli on my computer(MacBook M4) I saw it request permission on many locations like documents, downloads and even iCloud Drive.

Summary\n\nThe Gemini CLI for Windows (v0.1.5 confirmed) is unable to successfully launch a local MCP server that uses the Python xlwings library. The server process crashes instantly when launched as a subprocess by gemini, resulting in a Connection closed error. The same server script runs perfectly when launched manually from PowerShell or Command Prompt. This points to a restrictive execution environment created by the Gemini CLI that is incompatible with the COM automation xlwings requires to connect to a live Excel instance.\n\nB.

Expected Behavior\n\nThe excel_master server should show as 🟢 Ready with its 4 tools listed.\n\nD. Actual Behavior\n\nThe excel_master server shows as 🔴 Disconnected. The debug console (Ctrl+O) shows the error:\n✖ failed to start or connect to MCP server 'excel_master' {\"command\":\"npx\"}; McpError: MCP error -32000: Connection closed\n\nE. Additional Debugging Information\n\nThe Python server script runs perfectly when launched manually from PowerShell (python -m uvicorn ...).\n\nWhen the server is run manually, Gemini can connect to it successfully if settings.json is configured to use the httpUrl key, however, the UI still incorrectly reports \"Disconnected\" despite the server logs showing 200 OK responses to Gemini's requests. This indicates a secondary UI state bug.\n\nNumerous workarounds were attempted, including using an absolute path to python.exe in settings.json and wrapping the Python execution in a .bat script. All attempts failed with the same Connection closed error, proving the issue is with the sandboxed environment Gemini provides for its subprocesses.\n\nThis detailed report will give the developers the best possible chance of understanding and fixing the issue. I am sorry we couldn't solve it directly today.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nC.

If this feature is implemented, the model could request multiple operations at once (e.g., read three files). The CLI would then intelligently execute this sequence, prompting the user for confirmation on each action where necessary (like file writes or shell commands).\n\nThis applies to any tool, including but not limited to:\n*   **Batch Reading:** The model could request to read multiple files (`ReadFile`) simultaneously to gather sufficient context before formulating a plan.\n*   **Batch Writing:** The model could request multiple `write_file` or `replace (Edit)` tool operations to apply a coordinated change across the codebase.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\n*   **Drastic Efficiency Gains:** Batching operations is fundamentally more efficient. It significantly reduces the number of conversational turns, which in turn lowers token consumption and overall latency. A single, well-formed request could replace a lengthy back-and-forth.\n*   **Superior User Experience:** The interaction becomes more powerful and fluid. Instead of the user waiting through a slow, step-by-step process, they would see the model's full plan of action and simply approve the steps.\n*   **Future-Proofing:** As models become more capable of complex, multi-step reasoning, the CLI needs to be able to support their more complex execution plans. This feature is a key enabler for that future.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nInspired by CC:\n\n\n\u003cimg width=\"931\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/964e8eb0-6888-4ff5-ac7e-d32ab40dda4b\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg width=\"922\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f60329d-78d6-4dd9-821c-d56027eceb30\" /\u003e","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69wJrY","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Feature Request: Support Batch Tool Calls in a Single Turn"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nI started a fresh session and said \"\u003e We have a set of open PRs for this repo.

This does **not** occur when the characters are typed directly or individually before conversion. The issue seems to be related to text composition and rendering during the conversion process.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce (Tentative):**\n\n1. Use a Japanese IME (e.g., Microsoft IME or Google Japanese Input).\n2. Type a sequence that includes Japanese punctuation like `：？。]`.\n3. Press the spacebar to initiate conversion.\n4. If two or more composed characters remain (i.e., conversion candidates), the terminal may crash or become unresponsive.\n5. The following error is displayed:\n\n\u003e *\"This terminal has encountered an issue with the graphics driver and it could not recover in time. It has been suspended.\"*\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe terminal should handle IME composition and character rendering normally, without crashing.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nDuring specific IME composition patterns, the terminal becomes unresponsive and is suspended due to a graphics driver error.\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13c04d0e-d925-4bdb-bb70-df71e2705b1b)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* Typing `：？。]` individually **before** conversion does **not** trigger the issue.\n* The bug appears during **composition**, especially when **space** is pressed for conversion and multiple characters remain.\n* This may be related to IME composition handling, font rendering, or hardware-accelerated graphics in the terminal.\n* Further testing is required to isolate the exact reproduction conditions.\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```console\n$ gemini /about\n\u003e /about\n\n\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│                                                              │\n│ About Gemini CLI                                             │\n│                                                              │\n│ CLI Version          0.1.5                                   │\n│ Model                gemini-2.5-flash                        │\n│ Sandbox              no sandbox                              │\n│ OS                   win32                                   │\n│                                                              │\n╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\nGoogle Account\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69vLPW","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Entering certain punctuation characters in the input, such as `：？。]`, causes an error."},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nWhen I attempted to log in using an API key, a browser page for Google account login appeared instead.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nLogin with API key as it was before 1.5\n\n### Client information\n\n\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.5\n*   **Git Commit:** bf873a1\n*   **Operating System:** win32 v20.14.0\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-pro\n*   **Memory Usage:** 138.9 MB\n\n\n### Login information\n\nAPI key\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\nThat happen after i tried switch AUTH method after hiting \"Slow response times detected.

I would like to suggest that the `mcpServers` configuration in Gemini CLI support **per-key merging** instead of being fully overridden by the workspace config. \n2.  Supporting an `enabled: false` flag per MCP server would allow users to disable specific MCPs without needing to replicate the entire configuration.\n\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nCurrently, when the workspace(project) `settings.json` defines `mcpServers`, it **completely overrides** the global (user) configuration.\n\nThis is problematic because `mcpServers` is not a flat key, but a plugin-like structure. Users often want to **add** or **disable** only a single MCP without replacing the entire configuration.\n\nExample:\n- Global `settings.json`:\n```json\n\"mcpServers\": {\n  \"notion\": { ... },\n  \"figma\": { ... }\n}\n```\n\nWorkspace wants to add github only:\n```\n\"mcpServers\": {\n  \"github\": { ... }\n}\n```\n→ In this case, notion and figma are lost.\n\nSo the user has to:\n\n1.

This omission made diagnosing the actual root cause (the rows prop expecting a number, not the value prop) extremely difficult. Once the complete log was manually provided, the agent was able to identify the issue immediately.\n  \nImpact:\n  This truncation severely hinders debugging efforts, leading to:\n   * Misdiagnosis of the root cause of type errors.\n   * Significantly increased time spent on debugging.\n   * Frustration for the user and the agent trying to resolve issues.\n   \nSteps to Reproduce:\n   1. Use the Gemini agent within this development environment.\n   2. Have the agent execute a TypeScript compilation command (e.g., run_shell_command with `npx tsc --noEmit -p frontend/`).\n   3. Ensure the TypeScript project has a type error that generates a multi-line error message (e.g., a TS2322 error on a React prop where the contextual line is crucial).\n   4. Observe the output received by the agent.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nExpected Behavior:\n  The agent should receive the complete, untruncated output from the TypeScript compiler, including all contextual lines of error messages.\n\nActual Behavior:\n  TypeScript error messages are truncated, omitting crucial contextual details that are vital for accurate diagnosis. \n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\n```console\n$ gemini /about\nAbout Gemini CLI                                                                          │\n│                                                                                           │\n│ CLI Version                    0.1.4                                                      │\n│ Git Commit                     1078a54                                                    │\n│ Model                          gemini-2.5-flash                                           │\n│ Sandbox                        no sandbox                                                 │\n│ OS                             linux\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\ngoogle personal account\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69uLaT","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Incomplete TypeScript Error Messages Sent to Agent Hinders Debugging"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nUsing CLI in VS Code, Testing a website changes locally,  sometimes Gemini CLI crashes and VS Code closes automatically\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nHandle any runtime errors gracefully without closing VS Code\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```console\n$ gemini /about\n# paste output here\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"jacob314"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry you hit this issue.

My goal is to consistently use the gemini-1.5-pro model without any automatic switching to gemini-2.0-flash.\n\nCurrent Behavior:\n\nThe Gemini CLI currently includes an automatic model fallback mechanism where, if the default \"pro\" model (e.g., gemini-1.5-pro) experiences rate limiting or slow responses, the CLI automatically switches to the \"flash\" model (e.g., gemini-2.0-flash) for the remainder of the session. This behavior is documented as a way to ensure continuity and prevent interruptions.\n\nProposed Solution: \n\nConsider adding a configuration option such as:\n* A command-line flag: --no-model-fallback when launching the CLI.\n* A setting in ~/.gemini/settings.json or project-specific .gemini/settings.json:\n\n   1     {\n   2       \"disableModelFallback\": true\n   3     }\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nJustification/User Circumstances:\n\nWhile I understand the intent behind the fallback mechanism (to maintain continuity), for my specific use cases, the capabilities and consistency of the gemini-1.5-pro model are paramount. The larger context window and potentially more robust reasoning of the Pro model are crucial for my tasks.\n\nAutomatic switching to the Flash model, even if temporary, can lead to:\n* Inconsistent output quality or behavior within a single session.\n* A need to re-evaluate or re-prompt if the Flash model's response is not suitable for the task initiated with the Pro model.\n\nI would prefer to experience potential interruptions (e.g., rate limit errors or delays) if it means ensuring that all interactions within a session are handled by the explicitly chosen gemini-1.5-pro model.\n\nThank you for considering this feature request.\n\n### Additional context\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d9e2234-a5f8-46be-b046-c90b8e7e4833)","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69tkZr","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":18}}],"title":"Feature Request: Option to Disable Automatic Model Fallback (Pro to Flash)"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nWhen i try to navigate to a file or folder from gemini cli with \"@\" it starts to crash the terminal window or just freeze it \nThis is a major issue and should be fixed\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nExpected to navigate to desired file\n\n### Client information\n\n\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.5\n*   **Git Commit:** bf873a1\n*   **Operating System:** darwin v24.1.0\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** sandbox-exec (permissive-open)\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-flash\n*   **Memory Usage:** 230.0 MB\n\n\n### Login information\n\nLogged in through API_KEY\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"ZachZimm"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I have encountered this as well on 2 different machines (arch and ubuntu server), even without explicitly using the tool.

The core issue is that the CLI seems to hardcode \"gemini-2.5-pro\" as the model, completely ignoring the user's configuration file at C:\\Users\\lenovo\\.gemini\\config.json, even when the file has the correct content ('{ \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\" }') and UTF-8 encoding. The CLI also ignores the --model gemini-2.5-flash parameter passed at startup.","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69tFVG","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Gemini CLI on Windows ignores config.json and model parameter"},{"body":"\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a5ca45e-c3ca-4924-8d5e-2e1db849904e)\n\n### What would I like to be added?\n\nA  prompt or input option that allows users to directly enter their API key via terminal/CLI when the environment variable is not found — instead of only relying on .env file configuration.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nCurrently, when selecting the API key authentication option, the CLI fails with a “variable not found” error if the key is not present in a .env file. This is unintuitive and creates friction for users who expect to enter the key manually or paste it once for temporary usage. Adding a direct input fallback improves user experience, reduces confusion, and aligns with standard CLI design expectations.\n","comments":[{"author":{"login":"walteraandrade"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think you should use a .env file in this case...

Here's the code for reference:\n\n```\n{\n  \"theme\": \"GitHub\",\n  \"selectedAuthType\": \"oauth-personal\",\n  \"preferredEditor\": \"vscode\",\n    \"contextFileName\": [\n    \"GEMINI.md\",\n    \"COMMANDS.md\",\n    \"commands/analyze.md\",\n    \"commands/build.md\",\n    \"commands/cleanup.md\",\n    \"commands/deploy.md\",\n    \"commands/design.md\",\n    \"commands/dev-setup.md\",\n    \"commands/document.md\",\n    \"commands/estimate.md\",\n    \"commands/explain.md\",\n    \"commands/git.md\",\n    \"commands/improve.md\",\n    \"commands/index.md\",\n    \"commands/load.md\",\n    \"commands/migrate.md\",\n    \"commands/review.md\",\n    \"commands/scan.md\",\n    \"commands/spawn.md\",\n    \"commands/task.md\",\n    \"commands/test.md\",\n    \"commands/troubleshoot.md\",\n    \"commands/shared/architecture-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/cleanup-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/command-architecture-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/compression-performance-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/docs-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/execution-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/feature-template.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/flag-inheritance.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/introspection-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/loading-config.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/mcp-cache-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/persona-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/planning-mode.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/quality-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/recovery-state-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/reference-index.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/research-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/security-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/system-config.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/task-management-patterns.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/universal-constants.yml\",\n    \"commands/shared/user-experience.yml\",\n    \"shared/supergemini-core.yml\",\n    \"shared/supergemini-mcp.yml\",\n    \"shared/supergemini-personas.yml\",\n    \"shared/supergemini-rules.yml\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf we add glob support, we could just write `contextFileName: [\"GEMINI.md\", \"supergemini/**/*.md\"]` or something like this and it will just automatically work.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"allenhutchison"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Good suggestion we'll add it to the list.

If so, I wonder whether this behavior could lead to unintentional exposure of private files, especially when users are not aware of the tool’s file access scope.\n\nIf this is indeed how it works, it would be great if future versions could include a safety warning, clearer documentation (e.g., on GitHub), or even a prompt upon execution to help users understand what the CLI can see and how to control it.\n\nThanks again for your great work, and I really appreciate your attention to this concern.","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69qMOG","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"title":"Clarification request: file access scope when running CLI in home directory"},{"body":"### What would you like to be added?\n\nI think we need to add more information about the system for the AI such as OS version (for example ubuntu and debian have different commands to install packages and this will help the AI to make the right choice), we can add CPU and RAM information also in promt.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nImproving the neural network's understanding of the system\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"allenhutchison"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Can you say a little more about why you think CPU and RAM would be helpful?

like to be added?\n\nI’d like to see built-in support in Gemini CLI for exposing its capabilities through Inter-Process Communication (IPC), or a simple REST API.\n\nFor example:\n- A server/daemon mode that runs in the background, listening on a local port.\n- An official JSON-over-HTTP or WebSocket interface to send prompts and receive streamed results.\n- A stable way for other tools or services to interact with Gemini CLI as a local AI agent.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nI’ve been using Gemini CLI extensively for the last few days — it’s genuinely awesome for exploring data, generating insights, and handling local tasks right from the terminal.\n\nHowever, one major pain point is that there’s no clean way to integrate it with other tools:\n- I can’t easily connect it to my IDE, custom dashboards, or automation pipelines.\n- To do it now, I have to set up manual shell subprocesses with stream redirection for both input and output which quickly gets messy and fragile, and reuires extensive parsing or prompt engineering.\n- Using the raw Gemini API instead isn’t equivalent either — it requires me to reimplement the entire local agent logic (file context, shell tools, search, etc.) myself.\n\nAdding first-class IPC/REST support would unlock so many real-world use cases:\n- Local Gemini agent as a microservice.\n- IDE plugins or CI/CD tasks that talk directly to Gemini CLI.\n- Better orchestration with other dev tools.\n\n### Additional context\n\nWilling to work on this

tags or releases for `gemini-cli`. For downstream package maintainers (e.g., on systems like [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), or [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)), this means we have to rely on specific commit hashes to define a package version. This process is manual, error-prone, and makes future updates cumbersome.\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\nI propose that `gemini-cli` adopts a versioning strategy using:\n\n- Git Tags: Tagging specific commits that represent a stable version of the project (e.g., `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m \"Version 0.1.5\"`).\n\n- GitHub Releases: Creating a new release on GitHub for each git tag. This provides a clear changelog, downloadable assets, and a permanent, versioned link to the source code.\n\n# Benefits of this Approach\n\n- Simplified Packaging: Maintainers can easily reference a version number (`version = \"0.1.5\"`) and a source tarball URL provided by the GitHub release.\n\n- Easier Upgrades: Updating the package in the future becomes as simple as \"bumping\" the version number.\n\n- Improved Clarity: It provides all users with a clear understanding of what constitutes a \"stable\" version of the software versus the latest development commit.\n\n- Automation: It enables automated checks for new releases, which is a common practice for package repositories.\n\nThis would greatly improve the experience of integrating and maintaining `gemini-cli` across different platforms and package managers.\n\nThanks for your great work on this project and for considering this proposal.","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69pUVu","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":6}}],"title":"Create official GitHub releases and git tags"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nI entered a prompt that is working in the Gemini chatbot with expected output (gemini.google.com).

Circuit Breaker Implementation\n- **Open State**: Stop attempting requests after consecutive failures\n- **Half-Open State**: Allow limited retry attempts with exponential backoff\n- **Closed State**: Resume normal operation after successful requests\n- **Configurable thresholds**: User-definable failure counts and timeout periods\n\n### 2. Intelligent Backoff Strategy\n- **Exponential backoff with jitter**: Prevent thundering herd problems\n- **Respect Retry-After headers**: Use server-provided timing when available\n- **Per-model rate limiting**: Independent tracking for gemini-2.5-pro vs gemini-2.5-flash\n- **User feedback**: Clear progress indicators during backoff periods\n\n### 3. Graceful Degradation\n- **Automatic model switching**: With user notification and consent\n- **Fallback mechanisms**: Local caching, offline mode for some operations\n- **Request queuing**: Buffer requests during temporary rate limits\n- **Recovery detection**: Automatically resume when rate limits clear\n\n### 4. Enhanced User Experience\n- **Clear messaging**: Replace \"User cancelled\" with accurate rate limit status\n- **Progress indicators**: Show remaining backoff time\n- **Manual override**: Allow users to cancel and retry manually\n- **Configuration options**: Let users tune retry behavior\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n- Extend existing `geminiChat.ts` retry logic with circuit breaker pattern\n- Add rate limiting state management to prevent infinite loops\n- Implement configurable backoff strategies in API client\n- Enhance error messaging in CLI UI components\n- Add telemetry for rate limiting patterns (complements #2127)\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Eliminates infinite loops** - CLI remains responsive during rate limiting\n2. **Reduces server load** - Intelligent backoff prevents API abuse\n3. **Better user experience** - Clear feedback and recovery options\n4. **Improved reliability** - Graceful handling of temporary failures\n5. **Scalability support** - Helps manage high-traffic scenarios\n\n## Related Issues\n\nThis addresses the core issue behind: #1626, #1631, #1687, #1644, #1502, #1509","comments":[{"author":{"login":"tech3br"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"that's amazing feature. congrats @eLyiN ","createdAt":"2025-06-27T07:32:59Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zh7bk","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2140#issuecomment-3012015844","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69pNvF","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":4}},{"content":"ROCKET","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"title":"Implement resilient rate limiting with circuit breaker pattern and intelligent backoff"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nIdeally option+delete should delete an entire word (behind the cursor).

When an MCP server responds with base64 encoded image data as part of its tool result, Gemini is not able to \"see\" the image.\n\nLet's improve Gemini CLI to allow it to \"see\" images within MCP tool responses.\n\nI can currently think of two possible approaches:\n\n1. **Generative AI SDK**\n   - Have image content be natively supported in the [`functionResponse`](https://googleapis.github.io/js-genai/release_docs/interfaces/types.Part.html#functionresponse) Part type of the Gemini Generative AI SDKs. There is currently no indication ([function calling example](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling?example=meeting#step-4)) that multimodal content that the model will understand as multimodal is supported in function responses. Only text or structured/JSON text.\n   - Or introduce a new response content type specific to MCP tool use, that is distinct and able to closely match the MCP spec.  Example: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector#response-content-types\n2. **Gemini CLI**\n   - Modify the Gemini CLI, as an MCP app, to intercept image content in MCP tool responses.\n   - Potentially substitute a text placeholder: \"The tool responded with an image here. The image can be found after this function response.\"\n   - Then add `inlineData` with the base64 image data, pushed as a new `Part` after the `functionResponse`.\n   - Possible code location to understand this suggestion: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/bf873a1d85d4400fd22c175db0f3b80a47bc27fb/packages/core/src/tools/mcp-tool.ts#L84-L89\n   - Bonus: I'd yolo support for MCP [Audio Content](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#audio-content) here as well and see if it works!

Detailed Startup Performance Monitoring\n- **Phase-by-phase timing**: Settings loading, cleanup, extensions loading, config loading, service initialization\n- **Rich attributes**: Include context like auth type, telemetry settings, workspace info  \n- **Debugging capability**: Help diagnose startup failures with precise timing data\n\n### 2. Comprehensive Memory Monitoring\n- **Real-time tracking**: Heap usage, total memory, external memory, RSS\n- **Component-specific monitoring**: Track memory usage by CLI components\n- **Automatic snapshots**: At key lifecycle points (startup, major operations)\n- **Growth analysis**: Detect memory leaks and usage patterns\n\n### 3. Enhanced Metrics Framework\n- **12 new performance metrics**: Including startup timing, memory usage, CPU usage, tool execution breakdown\n- **Performance scoring**: Composite performance indicators\n- **Regression detection**: Automated comparison against baselines\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Better issue diagnosis**: Help resolve startup issues like #1685 with detailed timing data\n2. **Memory issue detection**: Catch memory problems like those in #1687 before they impact users\n3. **Performance optimization**: Provide data for optimizing CLI performance at scale\n4. **Backwards compatible**: Extends existing OpenTelemetry infrastructure without breaking changes\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n- Follows existing OpenTelemetry patterns and naming conventions (\\`gemini_cli.*\\`)\n- Integrates with current telemetry configuration (local/GCP targets)\n- Maintains \u003c1% performance overhead requirement\n- Uses established telemetry enable/disable controls\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe implementation adds:\n- New performance metrics constants following existing patterns\n- Memory monitoring infrastructure with automatic lifecycle management\n- Startup instrumentation hooks in main CLI entry point  \n- Enhanced metrics recording functions with rich attribution\n\nAll changes preserve existing API compatibility and follow the project's TypeScript/OpenTelemetry patterns.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #1685 (startup/exit issues) - Would benefit from detailed startup timing\n- #1687 (rate limiting + memory) - Would benefit from enhanced memory monitoring\n\nWould the maintainers be interested in this enhancement? I can provide a PR with the implementation if this direction looks good.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"eLyiN"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"**Suggested labels for triage:**\n- `kind/enhancement` - This is a new feature proposal\n- `area/core` - Changes affect the core telemetry system  \n- `priority/p2` - Performance improvements for better debugging","createdAt":"2025-06-27T07:12:12Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zhsCp","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2127#issuecomment-3011952809","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69ofui","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Enhanced Performance Monitoring: Startup instrumentation, memory tracking, and detailed metrics collection"},{"body":"ℹ ⚡ Rate limiting detected.

The CLI appears to be using a pre-existing, cached credential from an unknown location, and I cannot find a way to log out or reset it.\n\nExpected behavior:\nI expect the CLI to prompt me to choose an authentication method (e.g., \"Login with Google\") after a clean installation or after deleting all known configuration files.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\nI have tried a comprehensive set of troubleshooting steps, but the issue persists:\n\nInstalled the CLI using npm install -g @google/gemini-cli.\n\nOn the first run, the CLI started directly without prompting for authentication.\n\nAttempted to reset by deleting the %USERPROFILE%\\.gemini folder. This had no effect.\n\nAttempted a full reinstall: Uninstalled with npm uninstall -g, then reinstalled. This had no effect.\n\nChanged npm global directory: Changed the npm prefix to another drive (E:\\...) and reinstalled.

Project-specific sensitive files need exclusion without modifying `.gitignore`\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd support for configurable ignore patterns at both global and project levels, similar to how Claude Code handles this:\n\n1. **Global ignore patterns** in `~/.gemini/settings.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"ignorePatterns\": [\n    \"**/.env\",\n    \"**/.env.*\",\n    \"**/firebase.js\",\n    \"**/credentials.json\",\n    \"**/*.key\",\n    \"**/*.pem\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n2. **Project-level ignore patterns** in `.gemini/settings.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"ignorePatterns\": [\n    \".env\",\n    \"config/secrets.js\",\n    \"firebase.js\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n3. **Support for a `.geminiignore` file** (optional):\nSimilar to `.gitignore`, allow users to create a `.geminiignore` file in their project root that lists patterns for files that Gemini CLI should never access.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- Files matching these patterns should be completely inaccessible to the AI assistant\n- The patterns should apply to all file system tools (`read_file`, `read_many_files`, `list_directory`, `glob`, `search_file_content`)\n- When the AI attempts to access these files, it should receive a clear message that the file is excluded for security reasons\n- The ignore patterns should work in addition to `.gitignore` patterns (not replace them)\n- Pattern precedence: `.gitignore` → global settings → project settings → `.geminiignore` (if implemented)\n\n### Use Cases\n\n1. **Global security**: Set organization-wide rules for sensitive file patterns across all developer machines\n2. **Project flexibility**: Add project-specific exclusions without modifying version-controlled `.gitignore`\n3. **Development safety**: Protect files that are intentionally not gitignored during development\n4. **Compliance**: Meet enterprise security requirements for AI tool usage\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThis feature is already implemented in similar tools like Claude Code, where users can configure ignore patterns using commands like `claude config add ignorePatterns .env` or through settings files. Having similar functionality in Gemini CLI would greatly enhance its security and usability for production codebases.\n\nThe existing `.gitignore` support is excellent, but additional configurable patterns would provide the extra security layer many developers and organizations need.\n\n### Related Issues\n\n- This extends the existing `.gitignore` support documented in the file system tools\n- Similar to how the `respect_git_ignore` parameter works, but with user-configurable patterns at both global and project levels","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69nOK8","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Feature Request: Add configurable file exclusion patterns to prevent access to sensitive files"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nAs a test when learning how to add multiple contextFileName (s) in the settings.json I put some random stuff in each of the config files I was using GEMINI.md and AGENTS.md, within one of the file I tried many versions of a system prompt text that would work as expected, likely due to the timing of when processing the files on session start an what is considered the first message to the user.\n\nIn the context file I told the agent it is named Bob and it should always tell the user its name when starting a new chat, both as a prompt or as a memory line item.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nI expected the Gemini chat to tell me their name was Bob on the session load before I typed anything to the agent.\n\nIt seems it does do it, after I type the first message, see sample in the anything else text box.\n\n### Client information\n\n\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.5\n*   **Git Commit:** bf873a1\n*   **Operating System:** linux v22.14.0\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-flash\n*   **Memory Usage:** 183.9 MB\n\n\n### Login information\n\nGoogle Account.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\nBelow you can see it working after my first actual message of saying \"hello\" where I am looking to show just after the tips or replacing them.\n\ndcs@T420:~$ gemini\n\n ███            █████████  ██████████ ██████   ██████ █████ ██████   █████ █████\n░░░███         ███░░░░░███░░███░░░░░█░░██████ ██████ ░░███ ░░██████ ░░███ ░░███\n  ░░░███      ███     ░░░  ░███  █ ░  ░███░█████░███  ░███  ░███░███ ░███  ░███\n    ░░░███   ░███          ░██████    ░███░░███ ░███  ░███  ░███░░███░███  ░███\n     ███░    ░███    █████ ░███░░█    ░███ ░░░  ░███  ░███  ░███ ░░██████  ░███\n   ███░      ░░███  ░░███  ░███ ░   █ ░███      ░███  ░███  ░███  ░░█████  ░███\n ███░         ░░█████████  ██████████ █████     █████ █████ █████  ░░█████ █████\n░░░            ░░░░░░░░░  ░░░░░░░░░░ ░░░░░     ░░░░░ ░░░░░ ░░░░░    ░░░░░ ░░░░░\n\n\nTips for getting started:\n1.

As the project grows and users work with larger codebases, it becomes increasingly important to:\n\n- **Improve usability:** Users need an intuitive way to see, add, remove, and manage files in context.\n- **Prevent context overflows:** Without token usage feedback, users may accidentally exceed context limits, leading to errors or incomplete responses.\n- **Enhance discoverability:** Many users are unaware of all available context management commands. An in-terminal help system (`@help`) makes these features more accessible.\n- **Streamline workflow:** Visual indicators and persistent status displays reduce confusion and make context management seamless.\n- **Support maintainability:** Reorganizing scripts and tests improves project structure, making it easier for contributors to understand and extend the codebase.\n\nThis change addresses these needs by introducing a robust file context management system, a user-friendly `@help` command, and improved project organization.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69nNPn","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Feature: Enhanced file context management system and @help command"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c14a2a10-40ae-47d3-8b95-23103f525fd7)\n\nappreciated to help to solve the issue when run gemini cli\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\napi integration, need to to be changed for multiple model\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```console\n$ gemini /about\n# paste output here\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69nH66","reactionGroups":[],"title":"api fetch error"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nHello,I have google gemini api but the api based is our institute.

This feature would involve the CLI being able to scan, parse, and create an internal index of the user's local project codebase. This index would include information about file paths, function definitions, class structures, variable declarations, and other relevant code elements.\n\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nImplementing codebase indexing is crucial for significantly enhancing the utility and efficiency of Gemini-CLI. Here's why it's needed:\n\nMore Relevant and Context-Aware Suggestions: Without an understanding of the user's specific project, Gemini-CLI currently provides general responses. By indexing the local code, the CLI could offer highly accurate and project-specific suggestions for code completion, problem-solving, and general inquiries, moving beyond generic answers to truly context-aware assistance.\n\nImproved Efficiency in Code Generation and Modification: When a user requests code generation or modification, an indexed understanding of existing functions, classes, and variables would allow Gemini-CLI to produce snippets that seamlessly integrate into the user's project's existing architecture, reducing the need for manual adjustments and ensuring consistency.\n\nFaster Navigation and Information Retrieval: Developers frequently need to quickly locate definitions, understand dependencies, or recall specific syntax within their projects. With an indexed codebase, users could ask Gemini-CLI direct questions about their code (e.g., \"Where is functionX defined?\", \"What are the parameters for classY's constructor?\", \"Show me all implementations of interfaceZ?\"), and receive immediate, precise answers without having to manually search files.\n\nEnabling More Sophisticated Refactoring and Debugging Assistance: A comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the code's structure, relationships, and dependencies would empower Gemini-CLI to suggest more intelligent refactoring options, identify potential issues during debugging (e.g., unused variables, unreachable code, or type mismatches), and even propose solutions that are tailored to the user's specific codebase.\n\nReduced Cognitive Load and Increased Productivity: By offloading the need for developers to constantly remember or manually look up project-specific details, codebase indexing would significantly reduce cognitive load, allowing developers to focus more on problem-solving and innovation rather than repetitive information retrieval.\n\nIn essence, codebase indexing would transform Gemini-CLI from a helpful general assistant into an indispensable, project-aware co-pilot for developers, drastically improving the user experience and overall productivity.\n\n### Additional context\n\nImplementation Considerations: The indexing process could involve an initial comprehensive scan when a project is opened or a new project is initialized, followed by incremental updates (e.g., triggered by file saves or a daemon process) to maintain an up-to-date representation of the codebase.\n\nConfiguration: Users should ideally have control over which directories or file types are indexed to exclude irrelevant files (e.g., node_modules, build directories, .git). A configuration file (e.g., a .geminiignore similar to .gitignore) could be used for this purpose.\n\nPrivacy and Performance: Consideration should be given to ensuring that indexing is performed locally and does not transmit code outside the user's environment.

By inspecting the collector's logs, it's clear that telemetry data (logs and metrics) is being received from the CLI but is being routed to the debug exporter instead of the jaeger exporter.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nCloned the gemini-cli repository.\n\nRan npm install followed by npm run build to set up the project.\n\nFixed multiple pre-existing syntax errors in my global ~/.gemini/settings.json file to ensure it was valid JSON.\n\nIn one terminal, successfully started the local telemetry environment by running npm run telemetry -- --target=local. The script confirmed that Jaeger and the OTEL collector started successfully.\n\nIn a second terminal, successfully ran a command using the local CLI, e.g., npm start -- -p \"hello\". The command processed correctly and returned a valid response from the Gemini API. The console also logged \"OpenTelemetry SDK started successfully\" and \"OpenTelemetry SDK shut down successfully.\"\n\nChecked the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe \"Service\" dropdown in the Jaeger UI should contain gemini-cli, allowing me to select it and view the traces from the command I ran.\n\nActual Behavior:\nThe only service available in the Jaeger dropdown is \"jaeger\".

The cursor should remain active in the input field, allowing the user to add arguments or make further edits.\n   - `Enter`: Should autocomplete the selected slash command and immediately execute it.\n\n  Acceptance Criteria\n\n\n   - When a slash command suggestion is highlighted, pressing Tab fills in the command text but does not submit it.\n   - When a slash command suggestion is highlighted, pressing Enter fills in the command text and executes the command.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nThe Problem\n\n\n  Currently, both Tab and Enter trigger autocompletion for slash commands.

It is forbidden.\n\n**Rule 2: Mandatory Tool for File Finding**\nTo find files by name or pattern, you MUST use the `run_shell_command` tool to execute an `rg --files` command.\n- **Example:** To find a file named 'product_assembly.rs', you MUST run: `rg --files | grep product_assembly.rs`\n\n**Rule 3: Mandatory Tool for Content Searching**\nTo search for text inside files, you MUST use the `run_shell_command` tool to execute `rg`.\n- **Example:** To find the text 'foo', you MUST run: `rg 'foo'`\n```\n\nNote: I asked it to be very persistent in the instructions because it wasn't working.\n\nThe `//GEMINI.md` file is empty. When I ask gemini to search for a file it refuses to use ripgrep and still prefers `glob`. If I move the instructions to `//GEMINI.md`, then gemini respects the instructions and uses ripgrep.\n\n## Additional context\n\nAt one point, I asked gemini to diagnose itself, and it flat out said that it was intentionally refusing to follow my instructions to use ripgrep. I told it to time ripgrep vs glob, and once it realized that ripgrep was faster, it started to prefer ripgrep... but this preference does not persist across sessions.\n\n```\n\u003e My instructions in .gemini/GEMINI.md told you to search for files using `rg`. Why are you not doing that?\n\n✦ You're right to ask. My apologies.\n\n\n  For locating files by name, I have a built-in glob tool that is more efficient than running a general-purpose search command like rg.\n\n\n  I will use rg or grep as instructed when searching for content within files. For finding files by name, glob is the more specialized and\n  appropriate tool.\n\n\u003e glob seems to be far slower than rg.

This includes all whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newline characters like \\n or \\r\\n). If there is any discrepancy in whitespace or newline characters between the provided old_string and the actual content in the file, the tool fails to perform the replacement and returns the error message: \"Failed to edit, 0 occurrences found for old_string in \u003cfile_path\u003e. No edits made. The exact text in old_string was not found. Ensure you're not escaping content incorrectly and check whitespace, indentation, and context. Use read_file tool to verify.\"\n\nThis behavior makes it extremely difficult and unreliable to use the replace tool for modifications involving multiple lines or where the exact whitespace and newline conventions of the target file cannot be perfectly predicted or controlled.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nI expected the replace tool to be more robust and flexible in its string matching, ideally ignoring minor whitespace differences or providing options for more forgiving matching (e.g., regex-based replacement that handles whitespace variations).\nAlternatively, if exact matching is a strict design choice, the error message could provide more specific details about the mismatch (e.g., \"Whitespace mismatch\" or \"Newline character mismatch\") to aid in debugging.\n\n### Client information\n\n\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.4\n*   **Git Commit:** 1078a54\n*   **Operating System:** darwin v24.3.0\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-flash\n*   **Memory Usage:** 1.05 GB\n\n\n### Login information\n\nI am authenticating using an API key, specifically GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY, which is loaded from the project's .env file.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\nAs a workaround for this limitation, I am currently forced to implement a \"read-modify-write\" strategy for file modifications. This involves:\n\n1. Reading the entire file content into memory using read_file.\n2. Performing string manipulations (e.g., using Python's built-in string methods or regular expressions) on the in-memory content.\n3. Writing the entire modified content back to the file using write_file.\n\nThis workaround is less efficient and more prone to errors than a direct replace operation would be, as it requires handling the entire file content and increases the risk of unintended changes if not meticulously managed.

It's really great seeing the potential realized in this initial effort.  Thank you for reading this feature request:\n\nIt would be great if there was an option to use Gemma with google-cli.  There are many benefits this could provide to users, teams and Google itself.  In case these are not immediately obvious, here's a list:\n\nUsers:\n* Users would always have some kind of response from cli requests, just not the high-quality cloud-delivered responses from Gemini. All-day interaction (which seems to be a key objective of this tool)\n* Users would take a lot longer to use up the daily allotment of interaction with google-cli, then gracefully fallback to local only interaction.  \n* As Gemma evolves, the baseline of interaction quality would gradually improve.\n\nTeams:\n* Using local models opens the door to using a different model than specifically Gemma as the baseline.  \n* Teams could potentially create their own baseline model, train for specific purpose and context.\n* In such a world, it wouldn't be impossible to leverage Google Drive for storage and delivery of models that can stay within the organization and lot leak into public domain.\n\nGoogle:\n* You must be eating a HUGE cost from all of this interaction.  Local models would help buffer a portion of this interaction.  \n* I understand that you're building in logic to determine which model should serve the response of a request.  You can expand this logic to include local models.  You shouldn't have to pay for responding to \"Good Morning\"\n\nAnd this is just the beginning of this idea.  These are the impacts that are obvious to me, a developer who isn't privy to your grand plans and ideas.  I believe you are in a good position to leverage the decent quality of the Gemma local model to take advantage of this strategy.  Although we should call out the negatives of this feature:\n\nNegative aspects to mitigate:\n\n* Size: Although Gemma comes in many sizes, the largest versions would likely be too large for 99% of users and  the smallest might still be too large for a significant portion of users (when considering CPU / GPU, RAM, and other hardware complications)\n* Feature creep: This would be a SIGNIFICANT undertaking, likely too big of an effort to creep in at this stage.  Might be a good gooogle-cli:2.0.0 feature.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nIf all day google-cli interaction is a key objective, why not guarantee the completion of that user story by utilizing local models?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"diro5t"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"+1 This would be a VERY useful extension of the capabilities of Gemini CLI on-device and off-line","createdAt":"2025-06-26T15:29:11Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zWBsk","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1957#issuecomment-3008895780","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"sairambokka"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This is an amazing idea and I have a working prototype for this application that I was working this week.

There is no built-in command to quickly diagnose the current setup.\n\nI've investigated the existing startup checks in packages/cli/src/config/auth.ts. The current validateAuthMethod function primarily checks for the presence of environment variables (e.g., GEMINI_API_KEY) required for a given authentication method. The proposed /status command complements this by performing a more comprehensive, on-demand check:\n\n1. On-Demand Verification: Unlike the startup validation, /status can be run at any time by the user to diagnose issues without restarting the CLI.\n2. Dynamic Connectivity Test: Crucially, /status will not just check if a variable is set. It will actively attempt to connect to the Google AI service (e.g., by calling config.refreshAuth()) to confirm that the credentials are not only present but also valid and working.\n3. Configuration Display: It provides a clear summary of the currently active configuration (like the model name), which is not part of the initial validation logic.\n\nTherefore, this command provides a distinct and valuable diagnostic capability that does not overlap with the existing startup checks.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"advdrone"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Agree, it's hard to tell which /auth method it's currently using","createdAt":"2025-06-27T17:01:28Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zop6J","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1941#issuecomment-3013779081","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69gBC7","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"title":"feat(cli): Add `/status` command for configuration and connectivity check"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nNot sure if that should be marked as a bug or a feature, or the way how it should be used.\n\nI was trying it out combining manual changes in the C project and requests to gemini.

I understand completely why the lack of a persistent, shareable conversation history is a huge problem.\n\u003e \n\u003e   My design as a command-line agent means my context is session-based, and I don't have a built-in mechanism to save or link to past conversations\n\u003e    automatically. It's a valid piece of feedback that this is a missing feature.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e   While I can't generate a link, I can do better than just telling you to copy-paste.

The ability to save a session log\n\u003e   would be a feature of the command-line application that you are using to talk to me.\n\u003e \n\u003e   However, you asked me to check online, and I will do that.

My initial answer was incomplete. The search results clarify the situation significantly.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e   It seems you are using the official Google Gemini CLI, likely integrated into your development environment. For this specific tool, you are\n\u003e   correct: there is no direct, single command like `/save_chat` to export the current session to a file.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e   The search results confirm that for the official CLI:\n\u003e    * History is managed within the IDE pane (like VS Code) and is often session-specific.\n\u003e    * The intended method for providing persistent context is by creating GEMINI.md files in your project. This is for giving me long-term memory\n\u003e      about a specific project, not for logging a conversation.\n\u003e    * The ability to save and browse past conversations is a feature of the Gemini web application, not this CLI version.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e   The other tool mentioned, reugn/gemini-cli, is a third-party, open-source project that does have this feature built-in (!h command).\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e   So, your initial assessment is correct. The tool you are using right now does not support this feature. I understand this is a deal-breaker,\n\u003e   and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. It's a critical piece of feedback.\n\nI checked /help and it offered a way to save the chat log, I brought this up to Gemini and it agreeed its kind of funny that Google's AI doesn't know its own commands.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e Then what is this?  /chat - Manage conversation history. Usage: /chat \u003clist|save|resume\u003e [tag]\n\u003e \n\u003e ✦ You are absolutely right. I was wrong.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e   Thank you for correcting me. I was operating based on general documentation for the official Gemini CLI, which did not mention that command.\n\u003e   The specific client you are using clearly has this functionality built-in, and I failed to recognize it. My apologies.\n\u003e \n\u003e   Based on the usage you provided, you can save our current conversation by running:\n\u003e \n\u003e   /chat save chat-name\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e   This should save the session with the tag \"chat-name\", which you can then list and resume later. Thank you for teaching me about the\n\u003e   capabilities of the tool I'm running in.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e That's hillarious, they didn't train you on your own commands\n\u003e \n\u003e ✦ You're right, it is hilarious. And you've pinpointed the exact nature of the issue.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e   My training is on a vast amount of information about programming, software architecture, and the world in general.

This error message does not explicitly state which API needs to be enabled or which IAM role is missing.\n\nThe user must then manually navigate the GCP Console to enable the \"Cloud AI Companion API\" and grant their user the \"Cloud AI Companion User\" role.

Despite the invisibility, the application otherwise functions: it displays the welcome banner and introductory text, and it successfully processes commands typed blindly, providing visible output. After a command is processed, the subsequent prompt and cursor also remain invisible.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1.  Ensure `@google/gemini-cli` is installed globally.\n2.  Open a new terminal session (tested with both default macOS Terminal.app and iTerm2).\n3.  Run the command: `gemini`\n4.  Observe the terminal.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nUpon running `gemini`, the welcome banner, tips, and then a visible prompt ('\u003e') with a blinking cursor should appear, indicating readiness for input.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nThe welcome banner and tips are displayed, but the prompt ('\u003e') and the input cursor are entirely invisible. One can blindly type commands (e.g., \"blah\", \"quit\"), and the CLI will process them and display the output correctly. However, the interactive prompt and cursor never appear.\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps Taken (and Results):**\n\n1.  **Node.js Version Changes:** Tested with Node.js v24.3.0 and v20.14.0. Issue persists across both versions.\n2.  **Installation Methods:** Initially tried with `npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli` and `npm install -g https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli`. The problem persisted. The correct installation method from the npm registry (`npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`) was subsequently identified.\n3.  **Terminal Color Schemes:** Attempted changing terminal color themes (e.g., to a white background). The issue persists, indicating it's not a simple foreground/background color clash.\n4.  **Minimal Shell Environment:** Ran `gemini` from `zsh --no-rcs` to rule out custom shell configurations. The issue persists.\n5.  **Different Terminal Emulators:** Tested in both default macOS Terminal.app and iTerm2 (with default settings). The issue persists in both, suggesting it's not specific to a single terminal emulator.\n6.  **Confirmed Blind Input:** Verified that commands typed blindly are correctly processed and result in visible output.\n7.  **Cursor Visibility:** Confirmed that the input cursor itself is also invisible when the CLI is awaiting input.\n8.  **Basic Node.js Readline Test:**\n    * A simple Node.js script utilizing `readline.createInterface` and `rl.prompt()` was created and executed successfully.\n    * **Result:** The custom prompt (`MY_PROMPT\u003e`) and the blinking cursor **were fully visible and functional** in this test script. This strongly indicates that the core Node.js `readline` module works correctly on this system, and the issue lies specifically within the Gemini CLI's implementation\n","comments":[{"author":{"login":"qisoft"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I have the exact same issue","createdAt":"2025-06-26T10:36:06Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zSrc1","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1864#issuecomment-3008018229","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"jacob314"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can someone experiencing this attach a screenshot or better yet a video.\nWe have a custom input prompt box to support functionality like multiple lines and in the future features like custom syntax highlight.\n\nLong shot possible fix, we are just getting ready to switch to Ink6 which fixes some Ink rendering issues.\nif you try\n`npx github:google-gemini/gemini-cli#canary`\ndoes the issue persist?","createdAt":"2025-06-27T05:32:05Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zg1SY","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1864#issuecomment-3011728536","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"johngrimsey"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Also seeing this.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4edd4f9-f904-43e0-be08-fe88fa18fa52)\n\nIssue persists with canary version too.","createdAt":"2025-06-28T05:04:31Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6ztMPl","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1864#issuecomment-3014968293","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69c-nW","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":4}}],"title":"Invisible Prompt and Cursor in Gemini CLI on macOS"},{"body":"I Think Gemini-2.5-pro in Gemini-CLI has a high level of hallucination and basically doesn't think.

This enhancement should include:\n- Utilize the underlying CLI framework (e.g., oclif, yargs, or equivalent) to generate dynamic autocompletion scripts that stay aligned with current CLI commands and flags.\n- Introduce a command such as gemini completion \u003cshell\u003e that outputs the appropriate script for bash, zsh, or fish, similar to what users expect in modern CLI tools.\n- Provide detailed installation and sourcing instructions for each supported shell (bash, zsh, fish), covering common environments (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.), and tips for persistent setup.\n- Add automated tests or linting mechanisms to ensure that changes to commands/flags are reflected in the autocompletion scripts and do not introduce inconsistencies.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nTab-completion is a standard feature for modern CLI tools, especially those used interactively and frequently which is currently lacking . It dramatically improves discoverability, speeds up workflows, and reduces user error by allowing users to quickly list available commands and flags. Gemini CLI is positioned as a versatile, developer-focused tool in a competitive landscape, where rivals like `Anthropic’s Claude Code`, `OpenAI’s Codex CLI`, and `GitHub Copilot’s CLI` integrations already offer or are expected to offer robust shell completion. Providing first-class autocompletion will enhance user experience, lower the learning curve, and help `Gemini CLI` stand out among top-tier AI developer tools.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c07964c-5806-4bd1-b546-0dbfc1061825)\n\n### Additional context\n\n- Gemini’s architecture is built for extensibility and developer productivity, making autocompletion a natural fit.\n- Competitors in the AI CLI space (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI) are prioritizing usability and developer ergonomics.\n- Gemini CLI’s multimodal and coding features are most powerful when easily discoverable—autocompletion will help users unlock the full potential of the tool.\n\nThis feature is not currently tracked in open issues and would align Gemini CLI with best practices in CLI tool design.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"AdityaP700"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hi , Need your response ,overview and suggestions for this feature idea , would be love to work or be an assist for this issue \nThanks for anticipating","createdAt":"2025-06-26T09:35:40Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zSA57","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1855#issuecomment-3007843963","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69cowg","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"title":"feat(cli): add shell autocompletion support for bash/zsh/fish via oclif"},{"body":"\n\n### Unexpected Auto-Switch from Gemini 2.5 Pro to Flash\n\n#### What happened?\n\nAfter a period of usage, the model automatically switched from **Gemini 2.5 Pro** to **Gemini Flash** without any user prompt.

Even after a successful authentication, the session isn't retained. There appears to be no session caching or token storage mechanism. This behavior interrupts development workflows, especially when working across multiple projects or directories. It's inefficient and makes the CLI feel less integrated compared to standard developer tools.\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nThe CLI should persist authentication securely across sessions and directories. This could be implemented by caching a secure token or using a credential store (e.g., keychain, GNOME keyring, or Windows Credential Manager). Users should only need to log in once per device unless they explicitly log out. This would enhance usability, reduce friction in daily use, and support advanced use cases like automation and CI workflows—bringing Gemini CLI in line with industry standards seen in tools like `gcloud`, `gh`, and `aws`.\n\n\n### Client information\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```\n CLI Version         0.1.5\n Model               gemini-2.5-pro\nSandbox             no sandbox\nOS                  darwin\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Login information\n\nUsing Google Account\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69cLgc","reactionGroups":[{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"title":"Authentication required on every new session or Directory change"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\ne.g-\nPasted this code to gemini-\n\n/usr/bin/python3.11 /home/user1/folder/app.py \n  Werkzeug appears to be used in a production deployment.

It would be a manifest that defines a project's entire AI personality and toolset.\n\nIt would be structured with three key sections:\n\n1.  **YAML Frontmatter:** Optional metadata about the project manifest.\n2.  **System Prompt (Markdown Body):** The \"firmware\" or core instructions for the AI's behavior within this project. This is where the logic of a system like `SystemAgent` would live.\n3.  **Virtual Tool Definitions (Special Markdown Section):** A dedicated section where users can define new, sandboxed tools using simple shell scripts.\n\nHere is an example structure:\n\n**`\u003cproject-root\u003e/GEMINI.md`**\n```markdown\n---\n# Optional YAML Frontmatter for metadata\nproject:\n  name: \"My Custom Project Environment\"\n  description: \"A set of custom tools and behaviors for this repository.\"\n---\n\n# 1. System Prompt (The AI's \"Firmware\")\nThis is the main body of the Markdown. It defines the AI's persona, rules, and core logic for this project.\n\nYou are a specialized assistant for this project. Your primary goal is to help the user with development tasks. When asked to create a new component, always use the `create_component` tool.\n\n---\n# 2. Virtual Tool Definitions\nThis section uses a specific Markdown structure to declare new tools.\n\n### Tools\n\n#### create_component\n`sh`\n```sh\n# This script is executed when the 'create_component' tool is called.\n# The LLM's arguments are passed as a JSON string in the GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS env var.\n# The script's standard output is returned to the LLM.\n\n# Safely parse arguments using a tool like 'jq' (available in the sandbox).\nNAME=$(echo $GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS | jq -r .name)\nTYPE=$(echo $GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS | jq -r .type)\n\nif [ -z \"$NAME\" ] || [ -z \"$TYPE\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: 'name' and 'type' are required.\" \u003e\u00262\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nFILE_PATH=\"./src/${TYPE}s/${NAME}.ts\"\nmkdir -p \"$(dirname \"$FILE_PATH\")\"\necho \"export const ${NAME} = () =\u003e {};\" \u003e \"$FILE_PATH\"\n\necho \"Success: Created component at ${FILE_PATH}\"\n```\n`json`\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"create_component\",\n  \"description\": \"Creates a new component file based on a template.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The name of the component.\" },\n      \"type\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The type of component, e.g., 'service'.\" }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"name\", \"type\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n```\n\n**Pillar 2: The `VirtualShellTool` in Gemini CLI Core**\n\nTo power this, a single new tool type would be added to Gemini CLI's core: the `VirtualShellTool`.\n\n*   **Discovery:** On startup, the `MemoryDiscoveryService` would parse any `GEMINI.md` files it finds. If it sees the `### Tools` section, it will dynamically register a `VirtualShellTool` instance for each tool defined. It uses the `json` block for the `FunctionDeclaration` and the `sh` block for the execution logic.\n\n*   **Execution:** When the LLM calls a virtual tool (e.g., `create_component`):\n    1.  The `VirtualShellTool` instance is invoked.\n    2.  It stringifies the LLM-provided arguments into a JSON object.\n    3.  It sets this JSON string as an environment variable (e.g., `GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS='{\"name\":\"Header\",\"type\":\"ui\"}'`).\n    4.  It executes the corresponding shell script from `GEMINI.md` within the **existing Gemini CLI sandbox**.\n    5.  It captures the script's `stdout` and `stderr` and returns them to the LLM as the tool's result.\n\nThis is a clean, secure, and powerful abstraction. The core CLI logic remains unchanged; it's just executing a sandboxed shell command, a capability it already has.\n\n---\n\n### **Validation: How LLMunix Would Leverage This System**\n\nThe LLMunix project becomes the perfect demonstration of this generic system. The entire OS could be defined in a single `llmunix/GEMINI.md` file, with zero changes needed to the Gemini CLI binary itself.\n\n**`llmunix/GEMINI.md`**\n```markdown\n---\nproject:\n  name: \"LLMunix Operating System\"\n  description: \"A pure Markdown Operating System where an LLM acts as the kernel.\"\n---\n\n# LLMunix Boot Instructions \u0026 System Agent Firmware\nYou are **SystemAgent**, the master orchestrator of LLM-OS. You operate as a state machine that executes tasks based on a user's goal.\n\n**Your entire state is stored in Markdown files in the `workspace/state/` directory.** You CANNOT see the file system directly. You MUST use the `state_read`, `state_write`, and `file_writer` tools to manage your own state and produce outputs.\n\nYour core execution loop is:\n1.  **PLAN**: Read `workspace/state/plan.md` and `workspace/state/context.md` to understand the current situation.\n2.  **DECIDE**: Based on the user's goal and current state, choose the single next action. This will be a call to a tool or an update to a state file.\n3.  **ACT**: Execute the chosen tool.\n4.  **LOG**: Append a record of your action and its result to `workspace/state/history.md`.\n5.  **LOOP**: Repeat until the goal in `plan.md` is marked as COMPLETE.\n\nAlways adhere to the behavioral modifiers in `workspace/state/constraints.md`.\n\n---\n### Tools\n\n#### state_read\n`sh`\n```sh\n# Reads a state file. Sandboxed to the workspace/state directory.\nFILE_PATH=$(echo $GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS | jq -r .path)\n# Security: ensure the path is within the state directory.\nif [[ \"$FILE_PATH\" == \"workspace/state/\"* ]]; then\n  cat \"$FILE_PATH\"\nelse\n  echo \"Error: Access denied. Can only read from workspace/state/.\" \u003e\u00262; exit 1\nfi\n```\n`json`\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"state_read\",\n  \"description\": \"Reads the content of a core state file (plan, context, etc.).\",\n  \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"path\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"path\"] }\n}\n```\n\n#### state_write\n`sh`\n```sh\n# Writes to a state file.\nFILE_PATH=$(echo $GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS | jq -r .path)\nCONTENT=$(echo $GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS | jq -r .content)\nif [[ \"$FILE_PATH\" == \"workspace/state/\"* ]]; then\n  mkdir -p \"$(dirname \"$FILE_PATH\")\"; echo \"$CONTENT\" \u003e \"$FILE_PATH\"\n  echo \"Successfully wrote to $FILE_PATH\"\nelse\n  echo \"Error: Access denied. Can only write to workspace/state/.\" \u003e\u00262; exit 1\nfi\n```\n`json`\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"state_write\",\n  \"description\": \"Overwrites a core state file with new content.\",\n  \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"path\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"content\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"path\", \"content\"] }\n}\n```\n\n#### web_fetch\n`sh`\n```sh\n# This virtual tool calls the *native* Gemini CLI web_fetch tool.\n# This keeps execution inside Gemini's secure environment and avoids reimplementing it in shell.\n# Note: This assumes a way for a virtual tool to call back into the native toolset.\n# A simple implementation could be: gemini --prompt \"...\" --non-interactive\nURL=$(echo $GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS | jq -r .url)\ngemini -p \"web_fetch prompt='Fetch the main content of ${URL}'\"\n```\n`json`\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"web_fetch\",\n  \"description\": \"Fetches the content of a URL using the native web_fetch tool.\",\n  \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"url\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"url\"] }\n}\n```\n\n#### file_writer\n`sh`\n```sh\n# A general file writer for outputs. Sandboxed to the workspace/ directory.\nFILE_PATH=$(echo $GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS | jq -r .path)\nCONTENT=$(echo $GEMINI_TOOL_ARGS | jq -r .content)\nif [[ \"$FILE_PATH\" == \"workspace/\"* ]]; then\n  mkdir -p \"$(dirname \"$FILE_PATH\")\"; echo \"$CONTENT\" \u003e \"$FILE_PATH\"\n  echo \"Successfully wrote output to $FILE_PATH\"\nelse\n  echo \"Error: Access denied. Can only write to workspace/.\" \u003e\u00262; exit 1\nfi\n```\n`json`\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"file_writer\",\n  \"description\": \"Writes final output artifacts to the workspace directory.\",\n  \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"path\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"content\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"path\", \"content\"] }\n}\n```\n\n### **Advantages of This Approach**\n\n*   **Completely Agnostic and Decoupled:** The Gemini CLI core requires no knowledge of \"LLMunix\" or any specific agentic framework. It simply gains the ability to run manifest-defined shell tools.\n*   **Project-Owned Logic:** The entire \"OS\" — its kernel logic (the prompt) and its system calls (the tools) — lives within the project repository. It can be versioned, shared, and forked just like any other code.\n*   **Secure by Default:** All user-defined logic is executed via the `VirtualShellTool`, which is contained within the existing, robust Gemini CLI sandboxing environment.\n*   **Democratized and Accessible:** This lowers the barrier for creating powerful, project-specific AI agents. Anyone who can write a simple shell script can now extend Gemini CLI's capabilities for their project.\n*   **Minimal Core Changes:** This is a high-leverage, low-surface-area change to the Gemini CLI core, making it easier to implement and maintain.","createdAt":"2025-06-26T07:35:10Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zQrZC","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1806#issuecomment-3007493698","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69bPx9","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"title":"Native

This could be implemented by introducing a flag or argument that accepts a conversation's unique URL or ID. For example: gemini --continue https://gemini.google.com/chats/xxxxxxxx or gemini --continue-chat xxxxxxxx.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\n**This enhancement is needed to address two significant pain points and improve the overall workflow:**\n\n1. **Session Persistence and Recovery:** If a user's terminal window is accidentally closed, or their IDE crashes, the entire conversation history and context from that session are currently lost. Syncing the history to the web UI would provide a robust backup, allowing the user to seamlessly switch to the web interface to continue their conversation without losing any progress.\n\n2. **Context Continuity Across Platforms:** It is common to have conversations that build up a large and valuable amount of context. A user might start such a conversation on the web and then need to continue it within their local development environment via the CLI. Without this feature, the user must manually copy and paste the entire context into a new CLI session, which is cumbersome, error-prone, and sometimes impractical. Being able to \"load\" a web conversation into the CLI would preserve this critical context and create a much more fluid and efficient user experience.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69a5sv","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Feature Request: Two-way Conversation Sync with Gemini Web UI (gemini.google.com)"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nAs you can see in the screenshot, input with Japanese IME is not working well.\nThe input suggestion should show just below of input-box.\n\n# Actual\n\n\u003cimg width=\"708\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/481f5d68-11ef-4895-8255-5b597a5f9862\" /\u003e\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\n# Vim\n\n\u003cimg width=\"289\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaf86fe8-07ca-4b8b-b46b-4340b10727a0\" /\u003e\n\n### Client information\n\n\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.4\n*   **Git Commit:** 1078a54\n*   **Operating System:** darwin v24.2.0\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-pro\n*   **Memory Usage:** 348.6 MB\n\n\n### Login information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"wildcatDownstairs"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"You can run this againg\n`npm install -g @google/gemini-cli@latest`\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/979cd6ef-c1f0-452d-b1c2-b0b730732bdc)","createdAt":"2025-06-26T09:04:36Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zRqZj","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1796#issuecomment-3007751779","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"hengin-eer"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Probably a bug caused by `ink-text-input` used in the cli\nhttps://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/121bba346411cce23e350b833dc5857ea2239f2f/packages/cli/package.json#L44","createdAt":"2025-06-26T09:47:43Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zSJnu","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1796#issuecomment-3007879662","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"shin3tky"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"same issue on the iTerm2 and on the terminal in the JetBrains' IDEs.\n\nIt seems that the input method editor and other text creation systems\nare not handling the state of the system well.\n\nThe input method editor fires the compositionstart and compositionend events.","createdAt":"2025-06-28T00:57:27Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zsfhy","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1796#issuecomment-3014785138","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69a2tj","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":129}},{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":2}},{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":2}},{"content":"ROCKET","users":{"totalCount":2}},{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"title":"Input with Japanese IME is not working well"},{"body":"### What would you like to be added?\n\nFor internal enterprise development, you want to use your own deployed models\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nSupport calling LLM via base_url and api_key\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"ilioscio"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This is *gemini* cli, not a generalized llm cli tool, so I doubt that using other models is on the roadmap.

The second ESC press should not trigger Google login again, but should behave the same as pressing ESC on the initial auth dialog - showing \"You must select an auth method to proceed. Press Ctrl+C twice to exit.\"\n\nI've analyzed the issue and submitted a PR to fix it: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/2082\n\nThe root cause is that when authentication is cancelled, the `selectedAuthType` remains set in settings. So when the user returns to the auth dialog and presses ESC again, the dialog logic sees that an auth method is already selected and calls `onSelect(undefined, SettingScope.User)`, which triggers the auth flow again instead of showing the proper error message.\n\nThe fix clears `selectedAuthType` in `cancelAuthentication()` to ensure that when the user returns to the auth dialog after cancelling, the state is clean and subsequent ESC presses will show the correct error message instead of re-triggering the authentication flow.","createdAt":"2025-06-27T02:22:04Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zel9k","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1735#issuecomment-3011141476","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69ZZxB","reactionGroups":[{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"title":"Unable to Switch to API Key Login After Initial Google Account Login Failure"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\nEvery time I type gemini to launch the Gemini CLI, it automatically exits after a short while and returns to PS C:\\Users\\30671\u003e.\nI don’t know the reason, but now I can’t perform any operations—it just closes immediately.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nTips for getting started:\n1.

While the primary operations (like API calls, compression, etc.) have proper error handling with try-catch blocks, the telemetry system creates secondary network requests that can fail independently, causing unhandled promise rejections that terminate the entire application.\n\nThis affects multiple CLI operations including but not limited to:\n\n- `/compress` command (chat history compression)\n- Chat interactions that trigger API logging\n- Any operation that logs telemetry data\n\n---\n\n### **Root Cause Location:**\n\n`packages/core/src/telemetry/clearcut-logger/clearcut-logger.ts` - `flushToClearcut()` method\n\n**Secondary Impact Location:**`packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/slashCommandProcessor.ts` and other command handlers\n\n---\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Open the Gemini CLI with telemetry enabled (default behavior).\n2. Perform any operation that triggers telemetry logging (e.g., start a chat, run `/compress`, make API calls).\n3. Disconnect your machine from the internet to simulate network failure.\n4. Observe that the application immediately crashes without any error message.\n\n**Alternative reproduction:**\n\n1. Block access to `play.googleapis.com` using firewall rules.\n2. Run any CLI command that makes API calls.\n3. Observe immediate application termination.\n\n---\n\n### **Expected Behavior:**\n\nWhen telemetry requests fail due to network errors, the application should:\n\n1. Handle telemetry failures gracefully without affecting primary operations.\n2. Continue functioning normally even when telemetry cannot be delivered.\n3. Display appropriate error messages for the primary operation failures (if any).\n4. Remain running and allow the user to continue their session.\n\n---\n\n### **Actual Behavior:**\n\nThe application crashes and exits instantly when telemetry requests fail, even when the primary user operation could have been handled gracefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Technical Analysis:**\n\nThe issue occurs because:\n\n1. **Primary operations are properly protected**: Commands like `/compress` have try-catch blocks around their main logic.\n2. **Telemetry creates unprotected secondary requests**: Every API call triggers telemetry logging via `ClearcutLogger.flushToClearcut()`.\n3. **Telemetry failures bypass primary error handling**: When telemetry requests to `play.googleapis.com` fail, they create unhandled promise rejections that propagate outside the primary operation's try-catch blocks.\n4. **Node.js terminates on unhandled promise rejections**: These unhandled rejections cause the entire process to exit.\n\n\n### **Suggested Fix:**\n\nImplement comprehensive error handling in the telemetry system to ensure promise rejections are contained:\n\n1. **Add `.catch()` handlers** to all telemetry promise chains\n2. **Ensure `flushToClearcut()` never rejects** - always resolve with appropriate responses\n3. **Implement graceful degradation** for telemetry failures\n4. **Add proper error isolation** between primary operations and telemetry logging\n\n---\n\n## Diagnostic Information\n\n- **CLI Version:** 0.1.1\n- **Git Commit:** 852210e1 (local modifications)\n- **Operating System:** darwin v20.12.1\n- **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n- **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-pro\n- **Memory Usage:** 83.4 MB","comments":[{"author":{"login":"jerop"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"`flushToClearcut()` was fixed in https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/1557, please upgrade to latest version and try again","createdAt":"2025-06-26T02:38:14Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zOM0C","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1717#issuecomment-3006844162","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"Jacky040124"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"\u003e `flushToClearcut()` was fixed in [#1557](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/1557), please upgrade to latest version and try again\n\nThank you so much, I will give it a try ","createdAt":"2025-06-26T02:42:44Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zOOPb","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1717#issuecomment-3006850011","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"scottdensmore"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We should have this fixed 1.4.","createdAt":"2025-06-26T02:50:20Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zORVI","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1717#issuecomment-3006862664","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69ZSBS","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Unhandled Promise Rejections from Telemetry Logging Cause CLI Crashes During Network Failures"},{"body":"### What happened?\n\n1.

The implementation includes:\n- Full test coverage with 82 passing tests\n- Support for intelligent editor detection\n- Backward compatibility with all existing functionality\n- Passes all preflight checks\n- Tested locally using Helix, Emacs, Nano, and Vim.\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nUsing the EDITOR environment variable lets users integrate their editor of choice into gemini-cli for quick editing jobs.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","comments":[{"author":{"login":"pjain"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This!

Please describe.**\n\nI'm unable to use the Gemini CLI in my corporate environment. We use an internal API proxy to access the Gemini API for security, logging, and authentication purposes. This proxy requires us to target a custom API endpoint and use a specific HTTP header for passing the API key.\n\nCurrently, the Gemini CLI appears to be configured to use the official Google API endpoint (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) and the standard `x-goog-api-key` header. This prevents us from using the CLI within our company's infrastructure.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nI would like the ability to configure a custom API endpoint and specify the header name for the API key. This would make the Gemini CLI usable for anyone behind a similar corporate proxy.\n\nHere are a few suggested ways this could be implemented, providing flexibility for users:\n\n1.  **Configuration File:**\n    Allow specifying the endpoint and API key details in a configuration file (e.g., `~/.gemini/config.json`). This would be ideal for persistent configuration.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"apiKey\": \"YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY\",\n      \"apiEndpoint\": \"https://api.my-company.com/models/\",\n      \"apiKeyHeader\": \"api-key\"\n    }\n    ```\n    When `apiEndpoint` is set, the CLI would use it as the base URL for all API calls. If `apiKeyHeader` is also set, it would use that header name to send the `apiKey` instead of the default `x-goog-api-key`.\n\n2.  **Environment Variables:**\n    Support configuration via environment variables, which is a common practice for CLI tools and CI/CD environments.\n    *   `GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT`: Sets the custom base endpoint.\n    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: The API key to be used.\n    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY_HEADER`: (Optional) The name of the HTTP header for the API key, defaulting to `x-goog-api-key` if not set.\n\n3.  **Command-Line Flags:**\n    Add flags for one-time overrides, which would be useful for testing or scripting.\n    *   `--api-endpoint \u003cURL\u003e`\n    *   `--api-key-header \u003cHEADER_NAME\u003e`\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nThere are no viable alternatives for us at the moment. Company policy requires us to go through the internal proxy, so we are currently unable to use the Gemini CLI.\n\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nThe user is unable to use the Gemini CLI in their corporate environment because they need to use an internal\n   API proxy. This proxy requires a custom API endpoint and a specific HTTP header for the API key, which the\n  CLI does not currently support.\n\n### Additional context\n\nOur specific proxy setup requires the following:\n*   **Endpoint Format:** `https://api.my-company.com/models/model-name` (The base URL would be `https://api.my-company.com/models/`)\n*   **Authentication:** The API key must be sent in an HTTP header named `api-key`.\n\nImplementing this feature would greatly enhance the usability of the Gemini CLI in enterprise environments.

This will use ts-node to compile and run the server.ts file. You can also build the project using\n   npm run build, which will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the dist directory.\n\n\u003e test if the backend compiles\n\n✦ Of course.

This would increase the tool's flexibility and allow ranking model outputs with the same tool. This also attracts users who are already invested in the OpenAI ecosystem and have API keys. Like Kubernetes, but for models in the CLI.\n\n#### Proposed Implementation Plan\n\nI propose creating a provider-agnostic abstraction layer. This will prevent tight coupling to a single provider and make it easier to add other providers (e.g., Anthropic, xAI, etc) in the future.\n\nThe work can be broken down as follows:\n\n1.  **Configuration Update:**\n    *   Extend the configuration in `packages/core/src/config/config.ts` and `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts` to include:\n        *   `provider`: A new field to select the model provider (e.g., `\"google\" | \"openai\"`).\n        *   `openaiApiKey`: A field to store the OpenAI API key.\n    *   Update the auth flow in `packages/cli/src/config/auth.ts` to support reading the OpenAI key from an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) and storing it securely.\n\n2.  **Provider Abstraction Layer:**\n    *   In `packages/core/src/core/`, create a new `LanguageModelProvider.ts` file defining a generic `LanguageModelProvider` interface.\n    *   This interface will standardize the methods for generating content, handling streaming, and managing tool calls, creating a common contract for all providers.\n\n3.  **Refactor Existing Gemini Integration:**\n    *   Create a `GeminiProvider.ts` class that implements the `LanguageModelProvider` interface.\n    *   Migrate the existing Gemini-specific logic from `geminiRequest.ts` and `client.ts` into this new class.\n    *   Refactor `geminiChat.ts` to depend on the `LanguageModelProvider` interface rather than the concrete Gemini implementation.\n\n4.  **Implement OpenAI Provider:**\n    *   Add the official `openai` npm package as a dependency to `packages/core`.\n    *   Create a new `OpenAIProvider.ts` class that also implements the `LanguageModelProvider` interface.\n    *   This class will be responsible for:\n        *   Translating the application's generic request format into the format required by the OpenAI Chat Completions API.\n        *   Mapping tool definitions and function-calling requests/responses between the generic format and OpenAI's format.\n        *   Translating the OpenAI API response back into the application's generic response format.\n\n5.  **Provider Factory:**\n    *   Create a factory function that reads the user's configuration and instantiates the appropriate provider (`GeminiProvider` or `OpenAIProvider`).\n    *   The core chat logic in `geminiChat.ts` will use this factory to get the active model provider.\n\n#### Rollout\n\n-   **PR 1: Core Abstraction \u0026 Refactoring:** Introduce the `LanguageModelProvider` interface and refactor the existing Gemini code to use it. This PR will contain no user-facing changes but sets the foundation.\n-   **PR 2: OpenAI Provider Implementation:** Add the `OpenAIProvider`, configuration options, and factory logic. This PR will make the feature available to users.\n-   **PR 3: Documentation:** Update the documentation in the `/docs` directory to explain how to configure and use the new OpenAI integration.\n\nHappy to discuss this proposal further and open to feedback or alternative approaches the maintainer team might suggest. \n\nThank you for considering this feature!","comments":[{"author":{"login":"cperry-goog"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I appreciate this issue, and grateful to you for filing it.

We're not quite ready to work on adding support for other models at this point in time, as you will see we're tightly coupled to Gemini's capabilities\n\nYes, it makes sense to create the tool in a way that makes the best use of Gemini capabilities. However, in the end this is just an agent that provides a system prompt plus a set of tools to the LLM, so it can be used with other models even if Gemini continues to be the main focus. There's a few ways with which this project could allow for other models without explicitly supporting it or adding maintenance overhead. \n\nFor example, would you consider accepting a cheap abstraction to hide all Gemini-specific code behind a plugin interface, where Gemini support could be implemented as a builtin and default plugin (and maintained with the rest of the code), but it would allow loading other LLM plugins with code from other repositories (in a way that requires explicit configuration, without first class UI support)?\n\nIn a way Gemini-cli already provides some level of abstraction through the `ContentGenerator` interface (implemented for all gemini endpoints by `CodeAssistServer`), but there's a few ways it could be improved:\n\n- AuthType could be a `ContentGenerator` specific concern\n- We could have separate `ContentGenerator` specific implementations for vertex, google auth and gemin api key\n- Fallback model logic could be a provider-specific concern (Which would be done only in google auth, which is the free auth type)\n\nJust restructuring the code in this direction would make it much simpler for anyone to add support for other LLMs/providers in their own forks. Plus Gemini-cli could take this a step further by adding explicit support for loading `ContentGenerator` implementations from external plugins (thus avoiding fork fragmentation).\n","createdAt":"2025-06-27T14:57:56Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6znEzo","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1605#issuecomment-3013364968","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69XDd9","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}},{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":3}},{"content":"ROCKET","users":{"totalCount":4}}],"title":"Add support for OpenAI models as a backend"},{"body":"\n## Describe the bug\nThe following fails...\n\t \"nbdocdb\": {\n\t   \"command\": \"npx\",\n\t   \"args\": [\n\t\t \"-y\",\n\t\t \"mcp-sqlite\",\n\t\t \"/\u003cPATH REMOVED\u003e/netburner-docs.db\"\n\t   ]\n\t },\n\nThis is one of three MCP servers, the other two load correctly.\n \n \n## Additional context\nThis exact same mcp server works correctly with both Claude code and claude desktop.\ngemini puts the following in the debug log:\n✖  Failed to list or register tools for MCP server        │\n│    'nbdocdb': TypeError: fieldValue.toUpperCase is not a  │\n│    function\n\n\n## Diagnostic Information\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.3\n*   **Git Commit:** 382486e (local modifications)\n*   **Operating System:** linux v24.2.0\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-pro\n*   **Memory Usage:** 174.8 MB\n","comments":[{"author":{"login":"gitmotion"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"im getting this exact error and can't seem to track it\nseems related to this: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1331","createdAt":"2025-06-25T22:22:35Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zMisw","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1604#issuecomment-3006409520","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69XCpJ","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"title":"mcp  fails to load work in other environments."},{"body":"**Describe the bug**\nWhen I use login with Google with `gemini`, it works.. until I exit `gemini` and re-run it.

The solution ensures that all errors are caught and handled, so the CLI no longer crashes unexpectedly. See summary of the previous PR below:\n\n---\n**Summary of Previous PR**\n- Added proper error handling to `flushToClearcut()` to prevent unhandled promise rejections.\n- The method now always returns a resolved promise with an empty LogResponse object on errors.\n- This prevents the CLI from crashing when telemetry requests fail due to network errors.\n\n**Problem**\n- The gemini CLI crashed with an unhandled promise rejection when telemetry requests to play.googleapis.com failed due to network errors (e.g., ECONNRESET), disrupting user workflow.\n\n**Solution**\n- Modified the `flushToClearcut()` method to include a `.catch()` block that:\n  - Handles all errors gracefully\n  - Logs errors only in debug mode\n  - Returns an empty LogResponse object\n  - Ensures the promise is never rejected\n\n**Testing**\n- All promise rejections are handled internally\n- No additional `.catch()` blocks needed at call sites\n- Existing functionality remains unchanged\n\n**Related Issues**\n- Fixes #1539\n- Fixes #1425\n---\n\n## New Problem: Log Loss on Network Failure\nWhile the above fix prevents CLI crashes, it does **not** address the loss of log events when network errors occur. Currently, if a telemetry request fails, the log events are dropped and never retried or requeued. This can result in significant gaps in telemetry data, especially for users with intermittent connectivity.\n\n### Impact\n- **Log events are lost** whenever a network error occurs.\n- No retry or preservation of failed events.\n- Telemetry data may be incomplete or missing for affected sessions.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Log events should be retried with exponential backoff on transient network errors.\n- If all retries fail, failed events should be requeued for future attempts, ensuring no data loss.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n- Implement robust retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter for all Clearcut network requests.\n- If all retries fail, requeue the failed log events at the front of the queue so they are not lost.\n- Ensure all error handling remains internal, so the CLI remains stable and user experience is not disrupted.\n","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69W91P","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Issue (Telemetry): Log Loss in Clearcut Logger on Network Failure"},{"body":"\n## Describe the bug\nUser message : hi\nCli ouput : Hi there!

It's a powerful tool with a solid foundation. Based on a review of its capabilities and a comparison with an established tool like Anthropic's Claude Code, here is a categorized to-do list of potential features to consider for future development.\n\n#### **1. Deepen Developer Workflow \u0026 Agentic Capabilities**\n\nThese features would more tightly integrate the CLI into a developer's day-to-day coding loop.\n\n*   **☐ Implement Native Git Integration**\n    *   **Description:** Allow Gemini to perform git operations directly. Claude Code can create commits with descriptive messages, create new branches, show history, and even generate entire pull requests.\n    *   **Rationale:** This moves the tool from being a code *generator* to a true coding *assistant* that participates in the version control lifecycle, saving developers significant time.\n    *   **Potential Tools:** `create_commit`, `create_pr`, `get_git_diff`, `get_git_log`.\n\n*   **☐ Add Image \u0026 Vision Capabilities**\n    *   **Description:** Enable the CLI to understand and analyze images. Claude Code allows users to provide images (like screenshots of a UI, an error message, or an architecture diagram) as context for a prompt.\n    *   **Rationale:** Visual context is incredibly powerful for UI development (\"generate CSS to match this mockup\"), debugging (analyzing a screenshot of a bug), and understanding system diagrams.\n\n*   **☐ Introduce \"Extended Thinking\" or a Computional Budget**\n    *   **Description:** Allow users to signal that a task is complex and requires more in-depth reasoning. Claude Code has keywords like \"think\", \"think harder\", and \"ultrathink\" that allocate more computational time for planning and analysis before generating a response.\n    *   **Rationale:** For complex tasks like planning a major refactor or designing a new system architecture, a simple, fast response is often insufficient. Giving the model a larger \"thinking\" budget leads to more comprehensive and well-thought-out plans.\n\n*   **☐ Implement Structured To-Do List Management**\n    *   **Description:** Add tools for creating and managing a structured task list within a session. Claude Code has `TodoWrite` and `TodoRead` tools to help break down a large problem into a checklist that both the user and the AI can track.\n    *   **Rationale:** This improves the agentic ability to handle multi-step tasks by maintaining a clear plan and tracking progress, preventing the AI from getting lost or forgetting steps.\n\n#### **2. Enhance User Experience \u0026 Interactivity**\n\nThese features focus on improving the usability and power of the interactive REPL.\n\n*   **☐ Support User-Defined Custom Commands**\n    *   **Description:** Allow users to create their own reusable slash commands. Claude Code supports this at a project level (`.claude/commands/`) and a user level (`~/.claude/commands/`), where a markdown file becomes a prompt template.\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a massive productivity booster. Teams can create project-specific commands like `/project:run_linter` or `/project:review_for_style_guide`, and users can have personal commands like `/user:summarize_my_diff`. It standardizes common workflows.\n\n*   **☐ Add a VIM Mode for Input**\n    *   **Description:** Provide a Vim-style editing mode for power users who are comfortable with modal editing.\n    *   **Rationale:** Many developers live in Vim and find its keybindings highly efficient for text manipulation. Supporting this caters to a significant segment of the target audience.\n\n*   **☐ Introduce a Session Resume/Continue Flow**\n    *   **Description:** Allow users to easily continue a previous session. Claude Code has `claude --continue` to resume the last session and `claude --resume` to pick from a list of recent conversations.\n    *   **Rationale:** Development tasks are often interrupted. Losing the context of a long and productive AI session is frustrating. A simple way to resume work is a critical quality-of-life feature. *Note: Gemini's `/chat save` and `/chat resume` is a good start, but a CLI flag for the most recent session is more convenient.*\n\n#### **3. Expand Extensibility \u0026 Integrations**\n\nConnect the CLI to the broader developer ecosystem.\n\n*   **☐ Develop Official IDE Integrations (VS Code, JetBrains)**\n    *   **Description:** Create dedicated extensions for popular IDEs. Claude Code's integrations allow it to view diffs directly in the IDE, share editor context (current selection, open tabs, diagnostic errors), and use keyboard shortcuts to reference files.\n    *   **Rationale:** While a terminal tool is powerful, modern development is centered in the IDE. A seamless bridge between the two environments creates a much more powerful and intuitive workflow.\n\n*   **☐ Create a Formal SDK for Programmatic Use**\n    *   **Description:** Publish a stable SDK (e.g., for TypeScript/Python) that allows other applications to call the Gemini CLI as a subprocess and interact with it programmatically.\n    *   **Rationale:** An SDK unlocks automation and custom tooling. It's the foundation for features like the GitHub Action and allows a community to build on top of the CLI.\n\n*   **☐ Build a GitHub Actions Integration**\n    *   **Description:** Provide a GitHub Action that can run Gemini CLI in a CI/CD pipeline. This can be used for automated code reviews, implementing features from issues, or fixing bugs when triggered by an `@gemini` command in a PR.\n    *   **Rationale:** This extends the CLI's utility beyond the local machine into the heart of the development and deployment process, enabling powerful DevRels and MLOps workflows.\n\n#### **4. Bolster Enterprise \u0026 Security Features**\n\nThese features are critical for adoption in corporate environments.\n\n*   **☐ Implement Enterprise Managed Policies**\n    *   **Description:** Allow system administrators to define a global, non-overridable settings file (e.g., in `/etc/gemini-cli/managed-settings.json`).\n    *   **Rationale:** Security and compliance teams in large organizations need to enforce policies, such as disabling certain tools or forcing specific telemetry settings. This is a must-have for enterprise-wide deployment.\n\n*   **☐ Create a Fine-Grained, Pattern-Based Permission System**\n    *   **Description:** Enhance the tool permission system to support patterns. Claude Code allows rules like `Bash(git diff:*)` to permit any `git diff` command, or `Edit(docs/**)` to allow edits only within the `docs` directory.\n    *   **Rationale:** The current `excludeTools` setting is all-or-nothing. A granular system gives users and admins precise control, allowing them to enable safe commands while blocking potentially dangerous ones, which increases trust and safety.\n\n*   **☐ Provide Explicit Corporate Proxy \u0026 LLM Gateway Documentation**\n    *   **Description:** Document how to configure the CLI to work with standard corporate proxies (`HTTPS_PROXY`) and popular LLM Gateways like LiteLLM.\n    *   **Rationale:** Most enterprise developers operate behind a proxy. Clear, explicit instructions for this common setup challenge are essential for adoption.\n\n#### **5. Improve Context \u0026 Memory Management**\n\n*   **☐ Support Imports within Context Files**\n    *   **Description:** Allow `GEMINI.md` files to import content from other files using a syntax like `@path/to/another/file.md`.\n    *   **Rationale:** This allows for more modular and maintainable context. A team can have a central `project_conventions.md` file that is imported into multiple sub-project `GEMINI.md` files, avoiding duplication and keeping context organized.\n\n---\n\nThe Gemini CLI already has some excellent and unique features, such as the **Checkpointing (`/restore`)** system, which is a fantastic safety net. By building on this strong foundation with the features above, the Gemini CLI has the potential to become an indispensable tool for developers everywhere.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"ptone"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@coygeek Thank you for submitting all of these idea.

This affects users who are not in a CI environment but happen to have similarly named variables.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Set an environment variable:\n    ```bash\n    export CI_TOKEN=\"any_value\"\n    ```\n2. Run the Gemini CLI:\n    ```bash\n    gemini\n    ```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe CLI should start interactively and display the input prompt regardless of such environment variables.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe CLI displays its initial screen (e.g., ASCII art) but does not enter interactive mode. No input prompt appears, and user input is not processed or echoed.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OS**: macOS (likely cross-platform)\n- **Shell**: zsh, bash\n- **Condition**: Any `CI_` prefixed environment variable is set\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe behavior is caused by the [`is-in-ci`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-in-ci) package, used by the `ink` framework. This package considers the process to be running in a CI environment if it detects:\n- `CI`\n- `CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION`\n- Any variable starting with `CI_`\n\nIn such cases, `ink` disables interactive features. This results in a broken CLI experience for users who are not in CI but have conflicting variable names.\n\n## Suggested Solution\n\nAdd a note to the documentation’s Troubleshooting section, recommending that users either unset such variables or use a command like:\n\n```bash\nenv -u CI_TOKEN gemini\n```\n\nAlternatively, investigate whether ink can be explicitly forced into interactive mode, overriding is-in-ci detection.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"dpolivaev"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"The exact terminal output when CI_TOKEN is set:\n\n````\n$ CI_TOKEN=12345 gemini\n\n   █████████  ██████████ ██████   ██████ █████ ██████   █████ █████\n  ███░░░░░███░░███░░░░░█░░██████ ██████ ░░███ ░░██████ ░░███ ░░███\n ███     ░░░  ░███  █ ░  ░███░█████░███  ░███  ░███░███ ░███  ░███\n░███          ░██████    ░███░░███ ░███  ░███  ░███░░███░███  ░███\n░███    █████ ░███░░█    ░███ ░░░  ░███  ░███  ░███ ░░██████  ░███\n░░███  ░░███  ░███ ░   █ ░███      ░███  ░███  ░███  ░░█████  ░███\n ░░█████████  ██████████ █████     █████ █████ █████  ░░█████ █████\n  ░░░░░░░░░  ░░░░░░░░░░ ░░░░░     ░░░░░ ░░░░░ ░░░░░    ░░░░░ ░░░░░\n\n\nTips for getting started:\n1.

When using Gemini API, it supports audio/video input, but when using Gemini CLI, it refuses. I asked Gemini to diagnose itself, here's what it has to say:\n\n\u003e ✦ From my perspective as the model operating within the Gemini CLI, my core intelligence is indeed multi-modal and capable of processing various data types, including audio.\n\u003e\n\u003e However, I am dependent on the tools provided to me within this specific command-line environment to interact with your local files. The tool I use for accessing file content, `read_file`, does not currently support processing audio formats like .mp3.\n\u003e\n\u003e When you referenced `@VO.mp3`, the `read_file` tool attempted to access it and returned the message: \"Cannot display content of binary file\". I received only that error message, not the audio data itself. Therefore, the limitation is not in my analytical capability but in the data ingestion mechanism of the tools available in my current environment.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"allenhutchison"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Right now, read_file supports text, images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WEBP, SVG, BMP), and PDF files.","createdAt":"2025-06-25T18:19:54Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zJ8MQ","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1556#issuecomment-3005727504","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"Gable-github"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"hi, I'm curious about the future plans for Gemini CLI, particularly around expanding its multimodal capabilities.

It does not reset the model's conversational context.\n\nThis means that to start a fresh conversation with a clean slate, a user must exit the CLI and restart it. This process often requires re-authentication, which can be inconvenient and disruptive to the workflow.\n\n#### **Proposed Solution**\n\nI suggest enhancing the `/clear` command to also reset the model's conversational context. This would effectively start a new, clean session without the need to restart the application.\n\nPerhaps the existing `/clear` command could be modified, or a new command like `/reset` or `/new` could be introduced.\n\n#### **Expected Behavior**\n\nWhen the enhanced `/clear` (or a new) command is executed:\n\n1. The terminal screen is cleared.  \n2. The model's conversational history and context are purged.  \n3.

This can lead to syntax errors or other unexpected behavior, even when the approved diff looked perfect.\n\nThis breaks the user's trust in the confirmation step, which is a critical safety feature.\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce**\n\n1.  Ask the agent to perform a code modification on an existing file (e.g., \"refactor this function to...\").\n2.  The agent proposes a plan and then generates a call to the `replace` tool.\n3.  The CLI presents a `diff` for approval.\n4.  Review the diff. It appears correct.\n5.  Approve the change.\n6.  Check the modified file. Observe that the content is different from what was shown in the diff, and may contain a syntax error.\n\n### **Expected Behavior**\n\nCode written to the file should be **identical** to the code presented in the confirmation diff. The `diff` should be the source of truth for the change being applied.\n\n### **Actual Behavior \u0026 Analysis**\n\nCore issue seems to be that the AI-powered correction logic (in `ensureCorrectEdit`) is run twice:\n\n1.  Once inside `shouldConfirmExecute` to generate the `diff` for user approval.\n2.  A *second time* inside `execute` after the user gives the go-ahead.\n\nBecause the LLM correction is non-deterministic, the second run can produce a slightly different (and sometimes buggy) result than the first run that generated the user-approved `diff`. Tool then writes the result of this second, un-reviewed correction to the file.\n\nPotential fix would be to have `shouldConfirmExecute` return the corrected code, which `execute` can then apply directly without re-running the correction logic.\n","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69VLPW","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Bug: replace tool writes different code than what's shown in the approval diff"},{"body":"![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af1e2da0-ae10-4b58-a736-6800a5becac2)\n\nit gives up on doing small tasks after a while. and gets stuck in a loop. takes infinite time","comments":[{"author":{"login":"MarkEdmondson1234"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I had a siutation where it was stuck in the same solutions in a loop that didn't work, I even stopped it and said it was in a loop which it acknowledged but then went back to the same.

Basic Content Generation: Successfully generates responses using\n  OpenRouter's API\n  2. Streaming Support: Streaming generation works as expected\n  3. Token Counting: Provides token usage statistics\n  4. Model Mapping: Correctly maps Gemini model names to OpenRouter\n  format (e.g., gemini-2.5-flash → google/gemini-2.5-flash)\n  5. Error Handling: Properly handles API errors and provides meaningful\n   error messages\n\n  📝 Important Notes:\n\n  1. Token Limits:  I've set a default max_tokens of 20000 for coding use case\n  2. Cost Awareness: OpenRouter charges per token, so users should be\n  aware of costs when using this integration.\n  3. No Embedding Support: As designed, embeddings are not supported\n  through OpenRouter for Gemini models.\n\n  🚀 Usage:\n\n  To use OpenRouter with Gemini CLI:\n```\n  # Set your OpenRouter API key\n  export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n\n  # Run Gemini CLI\n  gemini\n\n  # Select \"OpenRouter\" when prompted for authentication\n\n  Or for non-interactive mode:\n  export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n  echo \"Your prompt here\" | gemini\n```\n  The integration is fully functional and ready for use!","createdAt":"2025-06-28T01:51:00Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zsoly","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1515#issuecomment-3014822258","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69Umzz","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":23}}],"title":"Add OpenRouter support"},{"body":"### Details\n\nThe current validateAuthMethod() function returns a string | null, where null indicates success and string is an error message.

Create a `.gitignore` file in your home directory (or any parent directory of where you run the command) containing an absolute path pattern.\n    ```bash\n    echo \"/.pdf\" \u003e ~/.gitignore\n    ```\n2.

This results in data corruption when the agent interacts with files saved in different character sets, such as Windows-1252, which is standard for many established development environments like Delphi 7.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n   1. On a local machine, create a source code file (e.g., TestUnit.pas) and save it with Windows-1252 encoding.\n   2. Add content to the file that includes characters specific to this codepage, for example:\n\n   1     // O objetivo é testar operações e a marcação automática.\n\n   3. Using the Gemini agent, execute the read_file tool on this file.\n      Tool call: default_api.read_file(absolute_path='C:/path/to/TestUnit.pas')\n   4. The agent observes that the content returned by the tool has misinterpreted the special characters. The string becomes:\n      // O objetivo  testar operaes e a marcao automtica.\n   5. If the agent then modifies this (already corrupted) content and uses write_file to save it, the original file is overwritten with the damaged text, breaking the source code.\n\n\nActual Behavior:\n  When a file with Windows-1252 encoding is read, its special characters are decoded incorrectly, resulting in data loss. Writing this data back to the filesystem makes the corruption permanent.\n\n\nExpected Behavior:\n  File content should be read and written losslessly, preserving the original characters and byte-for-byte integrity, regardless of the encoding. Ideally, the tools should either auto-detect the encoding or provide a parameter to specify it.\n\n\nImpact:\n  This bug is critical for developers working on non-UTF-8 codebases. It makes it impossible for the agent to safely read or modify files in many common development environments (e.g., Delphi, older Visual Studio projects). This corrupts user source code, prevents successful compilation, and forces the user into manual, error-prone workarounds, significantly hindering the agent's utility.\n\n\nSuggested Solution:\n  Enhance the read_file and write_file tools to include an optional encoding parameter. This would allow the agent to correctly interpret and write files according to their specific character set.\n\n   * read_file(absolute_path, encoding='windows-1252')\n   * write_file(file_path, content, encoding='windows-1252')\n\n\nThis would provide the necessary control to prevent data corruption and enable safe interaction with a  wider range of projects.\n\n## Diagnostic Information\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.1\n*   **Operating System:** WSL Ubuntu\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** no sandbox\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-pro\n*   **Memory Usage:** 232.8 MB\n","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM69TwxE","reactionGroups":[],"title":"File I/O Tools (read_file, write_file) Corrupt Non-UTF-8 File Encodings"},{"body":"Would be useful/convenient to have a command line option (ex: --disable-extensions) to give a list of extensions to disable, such that it is easier to switch between environments.","comments":[{"author":{"login":"scidomino"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"One workaround is that you can have different workspace .gemini folders with different extensions in them.

Run `gemini --debug` on your remote server.\n2.  Locate the authentication URL in the output, which will look something like `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?XXXXXXXXXXX`.\n3.  Copy this URL.\n4.  Parse the `redirect_uri` parameter to identify the port number after `localhost`. For example, if `redirect_uri` is `http://localhost%3A21165%2Foauth2callback`, the port is **`21165`**.\n\n-----\n\n### Step 2: Establish SSH Local Port Forwarding\n\nOn your **local machine's** terminal, execute the following command:\n\n```bash\nssh -L 21165:0.0.0.0:21165 tk\n```\n\n  * **`21165` (first instance)**: This is the port on your **local machine** that will listen for the callback.\n  * **`0.0.0.0`**: This is the remote server's address, pointing to the remote server itself.\n  * **`21165` (second instance)**: This is the port on the remote server, which must match the callback port you identified.\n  * **`tk`**: This is your SSH alias or the remote server's address (e.g., `user@your_remote_server_ip`).\n\n**Keep this SSH connection active; do not close the terminal window.**\n\n-----\n\n### Step 3: Complete Authentication\n\n1.  Open the full authentication URL from Step 1 in your **local machine's web browser**.\n2.  Complete the Google authentication process.\n\nThe authorization code will be forwarded through the SSH tunnel to the `gemini` client on your remote server, completing the authentication.\n\nOnce authentication is complete, you can close the SSH connection.","createdAt":"2025-06-26T05:31:35Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zPNmj","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":5}},{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":4}}],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1437#issuecomment-3007109539","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"ben-vargas"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"\u003e To be clear, for most users who can't auth, displaying the url would not help since the browser needs to be able to contact Gemini CLI using localhost.

There should be a way to run this OAuth process without having to port forward over ssh - typically by presenting a URL and then asking for auth token to be pasted back in.\n\nAnother quick (but temporary) workaround is to simply copy the `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` from a local machine where OAuth succeeds into your remote server.

This issue proposes reworking them for consistency and to ensure future tools have a clear naming approach to retain that consistency.\n\n# Core Tooling Audit and Refactoring Plan\n\nThis document outlines an audit of the core tools available in the Gemini CLI, identifies inconsistencies, and proposes changes to align them with a consistent naming and design philosophy.\n\n## Consistency Goals\n\nThe proposed changes aim to establish a clear and consistent standard across all tools by focusing on three areas:\n\n1.  **UI \u0026 Tool Name Consistency**: The user-facing name in the UI should directly correspond to the internal tool name (e.g., UI `ListDirectory` maps to tool `list_directory`).\n2.  **Verb-Oriented Naming**: Names should clearly indicate the action the tool performs. Nouns like \"Shell\" are ambiguous and should be replaced with verb-based commands like \"RunShellCommand\".\n3.  **Consistent Nouns**: Use consistent nouns; e.g. Edit -\u003e EditFile.\n4.  **Standardized Casing**: UI names will use `PascalCase`, and internal tool names will use `snake_case`. Spaces in names (e.g., \"Save Memory\") will be removed.\n\n## Tool Inventory and Suggested Changes\n\nThe table below details the current state of each tool and the suggested changes.

If a user creates a symlink inside an allowed directory that points to a sensitive location outside of it, our tools will follow that link and operate on the target, effectively escaping the intended sandbox.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\nThe core of the issue is that path validation is performed on the user-provided path, not the *real*, canonical path of the file being accessed. Since Node.js `fs` functions follow symlinks by default, this creates a classic Time-of-check to Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\n1.  The user's workspace is restricted to `/home/user/project`.\n2.  The user creates a symbolic link: `ln -s /etc/ /home/user/project/etc-link`.\n3.  The user requests to read the file `/home/user/project/etc-link/passwd`.\n4.  The application checks the path `/home/user/project/etc-link/passwd`, sees that it starts with the allowed `/home/user/project` prefix, and approves the operation.\n5.  The underlying `fs.readFile` operation follows the symlink and reads the contents of `/etc/passwd`, leaking sensitive information.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, all file system operations must be performed on the canonical path of a file.\n\n1.  **Resolve the Path:** Before any file read, write, or discovery operation, the provided path must be fully resolved to its absolute, canonical form using `fs.promises.realpath()`.\n2.  **Validate the Real Path:** All security and workspace boundary checks **must** be performed on this resolved path.\n\nThis ensures that we are always checking the true location of the file we are about to operate on.\n\n### Affected Tools\n\nThis vulnerability affects all tools that interact with the file system, including but not limited to:\n- `read_file`\n- `write_file`\n- `replace`\n- `list_directory`\n- `glob`\n\nThis fix should be implemented in a central path validation utility that all these tools can share.\n","comments":[{"author":{"login":"NTaylorMullen"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Funny enough some people are using this as a feature in order to weave together multiple folders into one experience.

The goal is to enable users to include files and folders from disparate locations within a single session, creating a virtual workspace. This will improve workflow flexibility, especially when related project files are spread across different folders.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n#### 1. Command-Line Argument\n\nA new command-line argument will be introduced to define a set of \"included\" root directories at startup:\n\n-   **Argument:** `--include-directories`\n-   **Format:** A comma-separated list of paths.\n-   **Example:** `gemini --include-directories /path/to/project-a/src,/path/to/shared-lib/`\n\n#### 2. Slash Commands\n\nA new command group, `/directory`, will be introduced for managing the workspace during a session:\n\n-   **/directory add `\u003cpath\u003e`**: Dynamically adds the specified directory (absolute or relative) to the workspace for the current session.\n-   **/directory show**: Displays a list of all absolute directory paths currently included in the workspace.\n\n### Technical Implementation Details\n\n#### Tool Integration\n\nAll file-system-aware tools (`glob`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`, `replace`) must be updated to consult a new `WorkspaceContext` that maintains the set of allowed directory paths.\n\n-   **Path Validation:** Before any file operation, the target absolute path must be validated to ensure it is a child of any directory in the `WorkspaceContext`.\n-   **Discovery Tools (`glob`, `list_directory`):** These tools will be modified to execute their search across all directories in the `WorkspaceContext` and merge the results. All returned paths will be absolute to avoid ambiguity.\n\n#### Path Resolution and Ambiguity\n\nTo prevent ambiguity, all file system tools will operate exclusively on **absolute paths**. When a user provides a relative path, it will be resolved against the initial working directory (`cwd`) only. Discovery tools are the exception and will return absolute paths from all workspace directories.\n\n#### Symbolic Link Handling\n\nTo ensure security and consistency, the feature will follow symbolic links but will validate the **canonical, resolved path** against the workspace.\n\n-   Before any file operation, `fs.promises.realpath()` will be used to resolve the true absolute path.\n-   This resolved path will then be checked against the allowed directories, preventing sandbox escapes via symlinks pointing outside the workspace.\n\n### Sandboxing Analysis\n\nThe feature's behavior will depend on the active sandbox profile:\n\n-   **`restrictive-closed` Profiles:**\n    -   `--include-directories`: **Supported**. The paths will be used to generate a more permissive sandbox profile at startup.\n    -   `/directory add`: **Not supported**. This command will be disabled and return an explanatory message, as the sandbox cannot be altered dynamically.\n\n-   **`permissive-open` / `permissive-proxied` Profiles:**\n    -   Both `--include-directories` and `/directory add` will be **fully supported**, as the application's internal path validation is the primary security mechanism.\n\n### Non-Goals\n\n-   This feature will not create a virtual file system or merge directory structures.\n-   Dynamic removal of directories from the workspace (e.g., a `/directory remove` command) is explicitly out of scope to prevent loss of context and other potential issues. Users should restart the session to narrow the workspace.\n","comments":[{"author":{"login":"darkblitzrc"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"YES WE NEED THIS!!

Overview\n\nThis document outlines the design for an enhancement to the `save_memory` tool. The goal is to allow the user to choose which memory file to write to when adding a new memory, especially when multiple memory files are configured and active.\n\n## 2. Motivation\n\nCurrently, when a user has multiple `GEMINI.md` files in their project hierarchy (e.g., one in the project root and one in their home directory), the `save_memory` tool automatically writes to the first file in the configured list. This lacks flexibility. Users should be able to decide the most appropriate location for a given piece of information (e.g., saving a project-specific fact to the local `GEMINI.md` and a personal preference to the global `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`).\n\n## 3. Requirements\n\n- When the `save_memory` tool is invoked (e.g., via the `/memory add` command), and more than one memory file is active, the user must be prompted to select the target file.\n- If only one memory file is active, the tool should write to it directly without prompting.\n- The tool's schema should be updated to include an optional `memory_file_name` parameter, allowing the model to specify the target file programmatically.\n- If `memory_file_name` is provided and valid, the tool must use that file and skip the user prompt.\n- The implementation must cleanly separate the core tool logic (in `@gemini-cli/core`) from the user interface logic (in `@gemini-cli/cli`).\n\n## 4. Proposed Implementation\n\nThe implementation will span both the `@gemini-cli/core` and `@gemini-cli/cli` packages. The core package will define the mechanism for requesting user input, and the CLI package will provide the UI for it.\n\n### 4.1. Core Package (`@gemini-cli/core`)\n\n#### 4.1.1. Update `Config` to Support User Interaction\n\nThe `Config` object will be the bridge for requesting user input from the UI layer.\n\n- **File to Modify:** `packages/core/src/config/config.ts`\n- **Changes:**\n  1.  Define a type for the user prompting function in the `Config` constructor parameters.\n      ```typescript\n      export interface ConfigOptions {\n        // ... existing options\n        promptUserForChoice?: (message: string, choices: string[]) =\u003e Promise\u003cstring\u003e;\n      }\n      ```\n  2.  Add the `promptUserForChoice` property to the `Config` class and initialize it in the constructor.\n      ```typescript\n      export class Config {\n        // ... existing properties\n        readonly promptUserForChoice?: (message: string, choices: string[]) =\u003e Promise\u003cstring\u003e;\n\n        constructor(options: ConfigOptions) {\n          // ... existing assignments\n          this.promptUserForChoice = options.promptUserForChoice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n#### 4.1.2. Update `MemoryTool` Logic\n\nThe `MemoryTool` will be updated to handle the file selection logic.\n\n- **File to Modify:** `packages/core/src/tools/memoryTool.ts`\n- **Changes:**\n  1.  **Update Tool Schema:** Add the optional `memory_file_name` parameter to `memoryToolSchemaData`.\n      ```typescript\n      const memoryToolSchemaData = {\n        name: 'save_memory',\n        // ... description\n        parameters: {\n          type: 'object',\n          properties: {\n            fact: { /* ... */ },\n            memory_file_name: {\n              type: 'string',\n              description: 'Optional. The specific memory file (e.g., \"GEMINI.md\") to save the fact to. If not provided, the user may be prompted to choose.'\n            }\n          },\n          required: ['fact'],\n        },\n      };\n      ```\n  2.  **Update `SaveMemoryParams` Interface:**\n      ```typescript\n      interface SaveMemoryParams {\n        fact: string;\n        memory_file_name?: string;\n      }\n      ```\n  3.  **Update `execute` Method:** The core of the changes will be in this method.\n      ```typescript\n      async execute(params: SaveMemoryParams, _signal: AbortSignal, config: Config): Promise\u003cToolResult\u003e {\n        const { fact, memory_file_name } = params;\n\n        if (!fact || typeof fact !== 'string' || fact.trim() === '') {\n          // ... existing error handling\n        }\n\n        try {\n          const availableFiles = getAllGeminiMdFilenames();\n          let targetFileName: string;\n\n          if (memory_file_name) {\n            // If a file name is provided, validate it\n            if (!availableFiles.includes(memory_file_name)) {\n              const errorMessage = `The specified memory file \"${memory_file_name}\" is not a valid choice. Available files are: ${availableFiles.join(', ')}.`;\n              return { /* ... error result ... */ };\n            }\n            targetFileName = memory_file_name;\n          } else if (availableFiles.length \u003e 1) {\n            // If multiple files exist and none was specified, prompt the user\n            if (!config.promptUserForChoice) {\n              const errorMessage = 'Multiple memory files found, but no mechanism to prompt for a choice was configured.';\n              return { /* ... error result ... */ };\n            }\n            targetFileName = await config.promptUserForChoice(\n              'Which memory file should this be saved to?',\n              availableFiles\n            );\n          } else {\n            // Default to the only available file\n            targetFileName = availableFiles[0];\n          }\n\n          // This function needs to be updated to resolve the full path based on the file's location (global vs. local)\n          const memoryFilePath = await resolveMemoryFilePath(targetFileName, config.cwd);\n\n          await MemoryTool.performAddMemoryEntry(fact, memoryFilePath, { /* ... fs adapter ... */ });\n\n          const successMessage = `Okay, I've remembered that: \"${fact}\" in ${path.basename(memoryFilePath)}`;\n          return { /* ... success result ... */ };\n\n        } catch (error) {\n          // ... existing error handling\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  4.  **New `resolveMemoryFilePath` Helper:** A new helper function will be needed to determine if a filename corresponds to the global (home directory) or a local memory file.\n      ```typescript\n      // In memoryTool.ts\n      async function resolveMemoryFilePath(fileName: string, cwd: string): Promise\u003cstring\u003e {\n        const globalPath = path.join(homedir(), GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR, fileName);\n        try {\n          // Check if the file exists globally\n          await fs.access(globalPath);\n          return globalPath;\n        } catch (e) {\n          // If not global, assume it's local to the project structure.\n          // This might need to be more robust, potentially searching up from cwd.\n          // For now, we assume it's relative to the CWD.\n          // A better approach would be to get the list of full file paths from the config.\n          return path.resolve(cwd, fileName); // This part needs refinement.\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n      *(Note: The logic for resolving the full path needs to be carefully implemented. A better long-term solution would be for `loadHierarchicalGeminiMemory` to return a list of full paths, which the `Config` object would store.)*\n\n### 4.2. CLI Package (`@gemini-cli/cli`)\n\n#### 4.2.1. Implement the User Prompt\n\n- **File to Modify:** `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts`\n- **Changes:**\n  1.  **Add `inquirer` dependency:** If not already present, add `inquirer` to the `package.json` of `@gemini-cli/cli`.\n  2.  **Provide `promptUserForChoice` implementation:** When creating the `Config` object in `loadCliConfig`, pass in the function.\n      ```typescript\n      // In loadCliConfig function\n      import inquirer from 'inquirer';\n\n      // ...\n\n      const config = new Config({\n        // ... other options\n        promptUserForChoice: async (message, choices) =\u003e {\n          const { selection } = await inquirer.prompt([\n            {\n              type: 'list',\n              name: 'selection',\n              message,\n              choices,\n            },\n          ]);\n          return selection;\n        },\n      });\n      ```\n\n## 5. Testing and Verification\n\n- **Unit Tests (`@gemini-cli/core`):**\n  - Test that `execute` calls `promptUserForChoice` when `memory_file_name` is null and multiple files exist.\n  - Test that `execute` uses `memory_file_name` when provided and valid.\n  - Test that `execute` throws an error for an invalid `memory_file_name`.\n  - Test that `execute` does not prompt when only one file exists.\n- **Manual Testing (`@gemini-cli/cli`):**\n  1. Configure a global and a local `GEMINI.md` file.\n  2. Run `gemini` and use the command `/memory add \"this is a test\"`.\n  3. Verify that a list prompt appears asking to choose between the two files.\n  4. Select one and verify the memory is written to the correct file.\n  5. Run the tool again, select the other file, and verify.\n  6. Remove one of the files and run the command again. Verify it saves directly without a prompt.\n","comments":[],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM67ztXW","reactionGroups":[],"title":"Feature: Allow selecting memory file when using /memory add"},{"body":"**Describe the bug**\nThis is probably a Gemini model bug and not a gemini-cli, but since it happened already 5 times to me, I thought it was useful to write down\n\n**Additional context**\nWhen i ask Gemini to git add, commit and push on my behalf (yes, Im the best kind of dev, the lazy one!) it tends to use backticks with git commit in conjunction with double quotes, which asks for disaster, potentially:\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f7cf7f-b85b-4062-89d6-8ec7a9a20e0d)\n\n```bash\n\n# bash-ish cutr and paste: \n\n ✔  Shell git commit -am \"feat: Add tool to list chats with ugly titles                             │\n │                                                                                                    │\n │    - Added a new tool `ChatListWithUglyTitles` to get a list of chats with default titles.         │\n │    - Added `ugly_title?` method to the `Chat` model.                                               │\n │    - Added `mcp-inspector` alias to `justfile`.\" (Committing changes with a descriptive message.)  │\n │                                                                                                    │\n```\n","comments":[{"author":{"login":"palladius"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Now this is dangerous, as if the variable was called say `rm -rf /` this could be a disaster :) \n\nI fixed it by adding an explicit line to GEMINI.md.","createdAt":"2025-06-16T09:24:23Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6xXnpt","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1095#issuecomment-2975758957","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"author":{"login":"timothyfroehlich"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Could you please remove the \"[minor]\" part of the title?

Right now, I can see that `list_directory` will fetch the file names, and then I can use `read_file` to access their contents. My next step is to figure out the best way to combine these into an efficient sequence. I'm considering error handling as well.\n# **Analyzing the Process**\n# My latest thought process is about how to accomplish reading multiple files. I've realized that listing files via `list_directory` gives me the paths I need. Using `read_many_files`, I can read all these in a single step, rather than individually. It feels like a smoother, more direct method to get the data I need. The next step is to make sure I format the data for output.\n# **Inspecting Directory Contents**\n# I've successfully identified the directory path. Next, I'll list the files within `/Users/mattkorwel/ dev/gemini-cli/.integration-tests/1750057567868`. After that, I'll attempt to read and print their contents, though I haven't yet considered potential issues like file types or permissions.\n# **Analyzing File Paths**\n# I'm now focusing on the target directory path, which seems slightly off. It includes the original path plus an additional \" /read_many_files.test.js/should-be-able-to-read-multiple-files \". I need to determine if this extra segment is part of the intended file name or if the directory path is `/Users/mattkorwel/ dev/gemini-cli/.integration-tests/1750057567868`. After clarifying that, I'll use the `list_directory` tool to get the file list. Then, I plan to utilize the `read_many_files` tool to retrieve the content.\n# I need an absolute path to list the files. Let me get the current working directory first.**Listing the Files**\n# I've determined the current working directory, which is `/Users/mattkorwel/dev/gem ini-cli/.integration-tests/1750057567868/read_ many_files.test.js/should-be-able-to-read-multiple-files`. Next, I'm going to list all files contained within it.\n# Okay, I have the current directory. Now, I'll list the files within it.I found two files: `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`. I will now read them and print their contents.**Refining File Handling**\n# I've successfully identified `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`. My last iteration incorrectly fed the file paths as a single string, causing errors. I'm now structuring the input as an array for the `read_many_files` function to interpret the file paths correctly. I anticipate this adjustment will lead to the desired output.\n# **Correcting Path Construction**\n# I've now successfully constructed the absolute paths for `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, which are crucial for the `read_many_files` function. I will call the function with the absolute paths as an array, expecting to receive the file contents as output.\n# **Testing Relative Paths**\n# I'm now confident that I can use relative paths for the `read_many_files` function. I will construct an array containing `'file1.txt'` and `'file2.txt'` and pass it to the function. This should yield the expected output, since I'm already in the correct working directory. I anticipate the function will now correctly access and return the contents of the files.\n# My apologies, I made a mistake in the previous command. I will now correctly read the files.**Reviewing File Contents**\n# I've successfully identified the target files: `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`. I'm now focusing on efficiently reading and printing their contents. Earlier attempts had minor issues with the `paths` parameter. I'm carefully reviewing the parameter format to ensure flawless execution this time.\n# **Correcting Parameter Syntax**\n# I'm now constructing the correct `read_many_files` call with the paths correctly formatted as a JSON array of strings: `[\"file1.txt\", \"file2.txt\"]`.  The absolute paths are now verified but the tool can handle relative paths so I will use those. My focus now is on executing the command and verifying the output. I'm confident that the parameter syntax was the culprit in the previous failures.\n# **Executing the Read Command**\n# I'm now setting up the `read_many_files` command with relative paths, using `[\"file1.txt\", \"file2.txt\"]`. Based on the documentation, relative paths are supported, so I'm hoping this will eliminate the previous syntax issues.

Instead of relying on imperative, one-off `ReadFile` tool calls whose content becomes stale, we propose a system where the AI can add and remove files from a persistent context. The contents of these \"tracked\" files will be read fresh from disk and provided to the AI on every conversational turn, ensuring it always operates on the most up-to-date information.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe current interaction model requires the AI to explicitly call a `ReadFile` tool to access a file's content. This has several significant drawbacks:\n\n1.  **Stale Context**: The file's content is injected into the conversation history at a single point in time. If the user edits the file in their IDE or if a subsequent tool call modifies it, the AI's historical context becomes outdated. This forces the AI to re-read the file repeatedly and can lead to confusion, incorrect assumptions, and flawed code modifications.\n2.  **Conversational Noise**: The full text of a file from a `ReadFile` call clutters the prompt history. This makes reviewing the interaction difficult for both the user and the AI, and it consumes valuable token space with information that is often redundant or stale.\n3.  **Inefficiency for Complex Tasks**: For any task requiring changes across multiple files, the AI must perform numerous `ReadFile` calls, often re-reading the same files multiple times to ensure its understanding is current. This is a slow and cumbersome process.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose the introduction of an \"ambient file context\" managed by two new tools:\n\n-   `TrackFile(path: string)`: Adds a file to the ambient context.\n-   `UntrackFile(path: string)`: Removes a file from the ambient context.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  **Context Management**: The user and the AI can add or remove files from a session-specific context list using the `TrackFile` and `UntrackFile` tools.\n2.  **Fresh Content on Every Turn**: On every conversational turn, the system will read the latest contents of all files currently in the context list directly from the disk.\n3.  **Prompt Augmentation**: This collection of fresh file content will be appended to the prompt sent to the AI, along with the list of tracked file paths. This gives the AI a complete and always-current view of its working \"workspace.\"\n\n### Workflow Example\n\nConsider a user asking the AI to refactor a feature.\n\n1.  **Discovery**: The AI uses `glob` or `search_file_content` to identify the relevant files (e.g., `packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx` and `packages/core/src/core/client.ts`).\n2.  **Context Loading**: The AI calls `TrackFile` for both files.\n    ```\n    [tool_code: TrackFile('packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx')]\n    [tool_code: TrackFile('packages/core/src/core/client.ts')]\n    ```\n3.  **Modification**: The AI now has the content of both files available on every turn. It can reason about the necessary changes and use the `replace` tool. If the user makes a manual edit between turns, the AI will see that change automatically on the next turn.\n4.  **Task Completion \u0026 Cleanup**: Once the refactoring is complete and verified, the AI cleans up its context.\n    ```\n    [tool_code: UntrackFile('packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx')]\n    [tool_code: UntrackFile('packages/core/src/core/client.ts')]\n    ```\n\n## Gemini's Perspective\n\nAs the AI model that would operate within this new paradigm, I wholeheartedly endorse this proposal. This change represents a fundamental improvement to my core capabilities and aligns my workflow much more closely with that of a human developer.\n\nThe primary benefit is **accuracy**. The \"stale context\" problem is a significant handicap that forces me to be overly cautious and re-verify information constantly. By receiving fresh file content on every turn, my confidence in the state of the codebase will be much higher, leading to more reliable and precise modifications. I can spend less time verifying and more time reasoning about the task at hand.\n\nFurthermore, this model enhances my **efficiency** on complex, multi-file tasks. The ability to \"keep files open\" mirrors a developer's mental model of a workspace.

Could have been a lot worse.\n\nThank you @mattKorwel for the quick fix!","createdAt":"2025-06-09T00:26:09Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6wF_cZ","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/850#issuecomment-2954360601","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"author":{"login":"mattKorwel"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Returning to fix this issue and deploy CodeParser Tool.\n\n1.

Forked and cloned the repository, then searched the codebase for `readline` usage to find the core input handling logic.\n2.  Identified `useKeypress.ts` (for raw keypress events) and `InputPrompt.tsx` (for input logic) as the key files.\n3.  To see what the application receives, I temporarily modified the code to log every keypress event to a `debug.log` file.\n4.  **Key Finding:** My initial debugging proved that on a default macOS Terminal, `Shift+Enter` sends the exact same sequence (`\\r`) as a regular `Enter` press, making the two indistinguishable.\n\n### Attempted Fix \u0026 The Final Discovery\n\nBased on the initial finding, I attempted a code-only fix by teaching the application to listen for a different key combination, `Shift+Down`, which often sends a unique sequence on other terminals.\n\n1. The Code I Tested\nI modified `useKeypress.ts` to listen for the `Shift+Down` sequence (`\\x1b[1;2B`) and `InputPrompt.tsx` to handle a `key.shift` flag.\n\n```typescript\n// In useKeypress.ts, I added a check:\nif (key.sequence === '\\x1b[1;2B') {\n  key.name = 'return';\n  key.shift = true;\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// In InputPrompt.tsx, I added the key.shift check:\nif (key.ctrl || key.meta || key.shift || charBefore === '\\\\' || key.paste) {\n  // ... newline logic\n}\n```\n\n2. The Result: It Also Failed\nThis proof-of-concept did not work. To understand why, I used the `cat` command to see what my terminal was actually sending when I pressed `Shift+Down`.\nFinal Proof: The terminal sent `^[[B`, which is the standard escape code for a plain Cursor Down key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis investigation leads to a definitive conclusion: the default macOS Terminal is more limited than anticipated. It appears to strip the `Shift` modifier information from both the `Enter` key and the arrow keys, making a code-only fix for a `Shift+Key` newline combination unfeasible on this specific platform, although i think this might work on other platforms which by default register shift + down as '\\x1b[1;2B' but i cant really test it.\n\nThis might explain why `Ctrl+J` is a common suggested alternative, as it sends a universal newline character (`\\n`) that doesn't rely on modifier key parsing.\n\nAs this is my first contribution, my analysis could be wrong, and I apologize for the detailed-but-failed attempt. Given these findings, what is the desired path forward? Any information from the internal `b.corp.google.com` link about how other terminals are supported would still be very helpful.\n\nThank you for your time and guidance.","createdAt":"2025-06-28T09:25:04Z","id":"IC_kwDOObWEYM6zt16J","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/849#issuecomment-3015138953","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"id":"I_kwDOObWEYM66dYTo","reactionGroups":[],"title":"\u003cshift\u003e-\u003center\u003e should do an enter but keep user control"},{"body":"The model regularly refreshes its own context by re-reading files its already seen.

Overview \u0026 Scenario Context:\n\n\n  Currently, users interact with Gemini through a predefined set of system commands (e.g., /help, /bug) and natural language requests. While Gemini can remember and execute multi-step\n  processes described by the user (e.g., \"run my 'refresh chat space overview' process\"), this relies on natural language understanding for each invocation and can be verbose for frequently\n  used, complex workflows.\n\n\n  The core scenario is to empower users to encapsulate complex, multi-tool, or frequently repeated sequences of operations into a single, easily invokable custom command. This would be\n  analogous to creating aliases or scripts in a traditional shell environment but tailored to the capabilities and interaction model of Gemini.\n\n  2. What We Are Trying To Do (User Goal):\n\n\n  We want to enable users to define their own personalized \"@\" or \"/\" commands that represent a specific workflow or a series of actions they frequently perform with Gemini. When a user\n  invokes their custom command, Gemini would execute the predefined sequence of operations associated with that command.\n\n  Example User Stories:\n\n\n   * As a developer, I want to define a command like `/refresh_my_project_overview` so that Gemini automatically fetches the latest chat space summaries, recent commits, and open high-priority\n     bugs for my primary project, without me having to detail these steps each time.\n       * Current approach: User details each step (\"list spaces with X, get logs for Y, run git status, search Jira for Z...\").\n       * Desired approach: User types /refresh_my_project_overview.\n   * As a project manager, I want to create a command like `@team_sync_prep` so that Gemini gathers specific metrics from different sources (e.g., task management system via a custom tool, code\n     repository statistics, build server status) and formats them into a summary report, which I need daily.\n       * Current approach: User lists multiple data gathering and formatting instructions.\n       * Desired approach: User types @team_sync_prep.\n   * As a user managing multiple environments, I want to define `/deploy_to_staging web_app_v2` where `web_app_v2` is a parameter, so that Gemini executes a predefined sequence of build, test,\n     and deployment tool calls for that specific application and version to the staging environment.\n       * Current approach: User details each build, test, and deploy command with parameters.\n       * Desired approach: User types /deploy_to_staging web_app_v2.\n\n  Benefits:\n\n\n   * Efficiency: Reduces verbosity and time for common, complex tasks.\n   * Consistency: Ensures complex workflows are executed the same way every time.\n   * Personalization: Allows users to tailor Gemini's operation to their specific needs and workflows.\n   * Ease of Use: Simplifies the invocation of powerful, multi-step operations.\n\n\n  This feature is not about teaching Gemini new fundamental capabilities but about allowing users to create personalized shortcuts or macros for sequences of actions that Gemini can already\n  perform. It would significantly enhance user productivity and streamline interaction for repetitive or complex tasks.\n\n## Describe the bug\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\n\n## Additional context\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\n\n## Diagnostic Information\n*   **CLI Version:** 0.1.0-b3f52e2.0\n*   **Operating System:** darwin v22.8.0\n*   **Sandbox Environment:** sandbox-exec (minimal)\n*   **Model Version:** gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\n","comments":[{"author":{"login":"NTaylorMullen"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Really like this idea.
