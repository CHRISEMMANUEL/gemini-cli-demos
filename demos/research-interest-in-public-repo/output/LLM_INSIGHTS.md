*   **Explanation**: These issues all describe the same critical bug where inputting Chinese or Japanese text fails, with only the last character being registered. Issue #2357 provides a detailed technical root cause analysis, tracing the problem to a specific pull request and its handling of byte streams.
*   **Course of Action**: Mark issues #2382, #2361, and #2358 as duplicates of #2357. Consolidate all reports into #2357 and prioritize it for an immediate fix, as it affects all international users relying on IMEs.

#### Group 2: `Shift+Enter` Does Not Create a New Line
*   **Issues**:
    *   [2408: Shift+Enter doesn't create a new line](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2408) (Windows)
    *   [2395: Shift+Enter](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2395) (macOS)
*   **Explanation**: Both issues report the exact same functionality bug: `Shift+Enter` sends the message instead of inserting a newline. The reports are from different operating systems, confirming it's a cross-platform issue.
*   **Course of Action**: Merge these two issues. Keep #2395 as the primary ticket and close #2408 as a duplicate, ensuring the cross-platform nature of the bug is noted.

#### Group 3: Authentication Flow Failures
*   **Issues**:
    *   [2354: Can’t cancel authentication CLI (Google Login) when I press exit](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2354)
    *   [2351: gemini cli Waiting for auth... (Press ESC to cancel) Login with Google Account](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2351)
    *   [2350: I can't login with Google on Mac](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2350)
*   **Explanation**: All three issues describe the "Login with Google" Oauth flow failing or hanging on both Windows and macOS. Issue #2354 adds that the flow cannot be cancelled once initiated.
*   **Course of Action**: Consolidate the investigation into a single ticket, preferably #2350. Close #2351 and #2354 as duplicates, but ensure the critical detail about being unable to cancel the process from #2354 is copied into the main ticket.

#### Group 4: Problematic Pasting Behavior
*   **Issues**:
    *   [2416: When pasting text that ends with '{' character in Windows Command Prompt, the text gets truncated...](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2416)
    *   [2393: The slow motion after pasting in the input box is just bloody awful...](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2393)
    *   [2389: copy/Copy the text and paste it... It will automatically send the text line by line...](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2389)
    *   [2342: Pasting long text is very slow](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2342)
*   **Explanation**: These issues describe different negative symptoms of the same feature: pasting text. The behavior is described as slow (#2393, #2342), causing truncation (#2416), and leading to auto-sending of incomplete text (#2389). They all point to a flawed paste-handling mechanism.
*   **Course of Action**: Group these issues together for a holistic review of the paste functionality. Cross-reference all four issues, as they provide a complete picture of the problems users are facing with this feature.

#### Group 5: Unresponsive or Erroneous `/privacy` Command
*   **Issues**:
    *   [2407: /privacy: Error loading Opt-in settings: User does not have a current tier](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2407)
    *   [2404: [Bug] privacy command becomes unresponsive on error](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2404)
*   **Explanation**: These two issues are directly linked. #2407 reports a specific error message from the `/privacy` command, and #2404 reports that this exact error causes the entire CLI to hang.
*   **Course of Action**: Cross-reference these two issues. The bug fix should address both the underlying error condition and the lack of graceful error handling that leads to the unresponsive state.

#### Group 6: `grep` Tool Pluralization
*   **Issues**:
    *   [2403: Typo in grep.ts](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2403)
    *   [2341: Improve pluralization handling of match in grep tool](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2341)

*   **Course of Action**: Close #2403 as a duplicate of #2341.

### General Insights and Course of Action

Based on the analysis of these issues, several recurring themes emerge, suggesting areas for strategic improvement.

1.  **Critical Input Handling Bugs**: The most severe and widespread issues relate to fundamental text input. The broken multibyte character support (Group 1) makes the CLI unusable for a large international user base. Combined with broken newline handling (Group 2) and problematic pasting (Group 4), it is clear that the current input mechanism is a major source of user frustration.
    *   **Action**: A high-priority investigation into the `readline` implementation mentioned in #2357 is required. Fixing the input handling should be the top engineering priority, as it will resolve numerous high-impact bugs simultaneously.

2.  **Brittle Authentication and Tier Recognition**: The authentication flow is fragile, with multiple reports of hangs and an inability to cancel (Group 3). Furthermore, the CLI is failing to recognize user subscription tiers (#2365, #2339), which undermines the product's value proposition for paying customers.
    *   **Action**: The entire authentication flow needs to be audited for reliability across different platforms and account types (Personal, Workspace, Paid). Fixing the paid tier recognition bug is critical for user trust and retention.

3.  **Platform-Specific Instability**: A significant number of bugs are specific to an OS, particularly Windows (#2331, #2330, #2416) and Linux environments like WSL (#2345) and specific terminals (#2328). This indicates gaps in cross-platform testing.
    *   **Action**: Broaden the test matrix to include legacy Windows Command Prompt, Windows Terminal, and various popular Linux terminal emulators. Issues related to shell integration, file system permissions, and terminal rendering need specific attention on each platform.

4.  **Demand for Power-User Features**: Users are actively requesting features that enable more advanced, professional workflows. Key requests include fine-grained command security (#2417), session management for scripting (#2384), and better shell integration (#2353).
    *   **Action**: These feature requests provide a clear roadmap for evolving the CLI into a more powerful developer tool. Prioritize features that unblock agentic workflows and improve safety, as these appear to be highly valued by the user base.
