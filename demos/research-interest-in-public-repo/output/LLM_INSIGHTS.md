- **Explanation:** All these issues describe the same critical bug: the CLI detects rate limiting or slow responses, announces a switch from the "Pro" to "Flash" model, and then becomes unresponsive, gets stuck in an infinite loop of notifications, or fails to complete the user's request. This is a single, widespread, high-priority problem.
- **Course of Action:** Create a master tracking issue for the "Rate Limit/Model Fallback Loop" bug. Merge all other issues into it or close them as duplicates. This requires immediate attention as it makes the CLI unusable for many.

---

**Group 2: Multibyte/International Character Input Bug (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese)**

- **Issues:**
  - [#2382](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2382): Typing in Chinese in gemini-cli, only the last character is displayed
  - [#2361](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2361): Only the last character is entered when I type Japanese.
  - [#2358](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2358): Issue with Japanese input reflecting only the last character
  - [#2357](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2357): Chinese/multibyte character input broken after PR #1972 (readline implementation)
  - [#1984](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1984): Gemini cli error on typing vietnamese (with app support for typing Vietnamese as Unikey, EVkey,..)
- **Explanation:** These issues are all reports of the same bug where inputting CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) or other multibyte characters fails. Only the last character or byte of a sequence is registered in the input field. Issue #2357 provides an excellent root cause analysis, pointing to a specific `readline` implementation.
- **Course of Action:** Merge all other issues into #2357, as it contains the most detailed technical analysis. This is a high-priority bug affecting international users.

---

**Group 3: Shift+Enter Does Not Create a New Line**

- **Issues:**
  - [#2408](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2408): Shift+Enter doesn't create a new line
  - [#2395](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2395): Shift+Enter
  - [#849](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/849): <shift>-<enter> should do an enter but keep user control
- **Explanation:** Users on both Windows and macOS report that the `Shift+Enter` key combination, which is expected to create a newline for multi-line input, instead submits the prompt.
- **Course of Action:** Merge #2395 and #849 into #2408. This is a straightforward UI/UX bug that should be addressed for usability.

---

**Group 4: Authentication Hangs or Fails to Complete**

- **Issues:**
  - [#2351](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2351): gemini cli Waiting for auth... (Press ESC to cancel) Login with Google Account
  - [#2350](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2350): I can't login with Google on Mac
  - [#2209](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2209): Authentication process hangs in terminal after successful browser authorization
  - [#2081](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2081): Failed to login
  - [#1959](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1959): not working in my mac
  - [#1901](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1901): always keep me on the login process
  - [#1835](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1835): Gemini stuck in Waiting for auth loop
  - [#1810](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1810): When installing from Codespace, unable to authenticate
  - [#1437](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1437): Login with Google - Doesn't support (SSH Issue?) for headless login
- **Explanation:** These users all report that the OAuth flow for "Login with Google" gets stuck. They are redirected to a browser, successfully authenticate, but the CLI never receives the callback and remains in a "Waiting for auth..." state. This is especially prevalent on macOS and in headless environments like SSH or Codespaces.
- **Course of Action:** These issues are highly related and likely stem from the same problem in the local callback server. Group them under a single tracking issue titled "OAuth Authentication Flow Hangs on macOS and Headless Environments."

---

**Group 5: Request for Persistent Authentication**

- **Issues:**
  - [#2135](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2135): Don't verify auth every time you open gemini-cli
  - [#1837](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1837): Authentication required on every new session or Directory change
  - [#1834](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1834): Persistent Auth Session
  - [#1603](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1603): Sign in with Google doesn't save?
- **Explanation:** These are all feature requests asking for the same thing: authentication should be persisted across sessions so the user doesn't have to log in every time they start the CLI.
- **Course of Action:** Merge these into a single feature request, for example, by making #1837 the primary issue.

---

**Group 6: Invalid Function/Tool Name API Errors**

- **Issues:**
  - [#2200](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2200): Auth issue
  - [#2194](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2194): API Errors for every authorization method
  - [#2031](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2031): After adding azure-devops-mcp server to gemini-cli settings.json all prompts throw an error
- **Explanation:** These issues all report a `400 Bad Request` API error with the message "Invalid function name. Must start with a letter or an underscore...". This indicates a problem with how MCP server tools or internal tools are being registered and sent to the API.
- **Course of Action:** These are likely caused by the same schema validation issue, especially when third-party MCP servers are involved. Group them and investigate the tool registration process as the root cause.

---

**Group 7: Failures and Loops with the `replace` / `edit` Tool**

- **Issues:**
  - [#2349](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2349): replace tool issue  always repeat
  - [#2275](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2275): Gemini-cli replace tool is failing when attempting to modify configuration files
  - [#2101](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2101): Gemini never seems to be able to edit a file
  - [#1971](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1971): replace tool fails on non-exact string matches (whitespace/newlines)
  - [#1533](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1533): Bug: replace tool writes different code than what's shown in the approval diff
  - [#1028](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1028): Repeated issues with the `replace` tool
- **Explanation:** All of these issues report significant problems with the `replace` (or `edit`) tool. Common themes include the tool failing when the target string appears multiple times, being too strict about whitespace, getting stuck in retry loops, or writing different content than what was approved in the diff.
- **Course of Action:** This is a critical tool reliability problem. Create a master tracking issue titled "Improve Reliability and Robustness of the `replace` Tool" and link all these related issues to it.

---

**Group 8: Inconsistent or Disappearing Chat History (`/chat save`)**

- **Issues:**
  - [#2374](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2374): chat history is gone after restart
  - [#2296](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2296): /chat list not showing saved chats
  - [#2189](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2189): Bug: /chat save fails silently when no tag is provided
  - [#1946](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1946): I can't use the /save function. It doesn’t show the conversation list, and it doesn’t save the conversation.
- **Explanation:** Users report that the `/chat save` and `/chat list` commands are unreliable. Saved chats sometimes disappear on restart or are not listed, and the command can fail silently if no tag is provided.
- **Course of Action:** These are all bugs related to the chat persistence feature. Group them under a single bug report to investigate and fix the chat history management logic.

---

**Group 9: Feature Request for Custom Slash Commands**

- **Issues:**
  - [#2322](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2322): please add custom slash commands similar to those allowed by claude code.
  - [#805](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/805): FR write down my own "@" or "/" commands as defined in the GEMINI.md file
- **Explanation:** Both issues request the ability for users to define their own custom slash commands, likely by using prompt templates in a configuration file, a feature popular in other AI CLIs.
- **Course of Action:** Merge #805 into #2322 as a single, clear feature request.

1.  **Critical Stability and Usability Issues:** The most frequently reported problems are showstoppers: the rate-limiting/fallback loop, broken multibyte character input, and authentication hangs. These issues make the CLI unusable for large groups of users and should be the highest priority.
2.  **User Experience Friction:** Many issues point to significant UX friction. The lack of persistent auth, poor handling of long-running commands (hangs, unresponsive UI), unreliable core tools (`replace`), and confusing error messages are major themes. A concerted effort to improve the robustness and polish of the core interactive loop is needed.
3.  **Demand for Feature Parity:** A large volume of feature requests explicitly reference capabilities found in competitors (especially Claude Code). Key areas include better session management, custom commands, SDKs for programmatic use, and more powerful context management (`.geminiignore`, multi-directory support). This provides a clear, user-driven roadmap for future development.
4.  **Platform-Specific Bugs:** There are numerous bugs specific to Windows (path escaping, command execution, IME issues) and macOS (auth hangs, editor detection). The testing matrix should be expanded to better cover these platforms and their unique environments (PowerShell vs. cmd, Homebrew installs, etc.).
5.  **Documentation and Onboarding Gaps:** Users are confused about authentication (especially for Workspace accounts), proxy configuration, and pricing/data privacy policies. The documentation needs to be more comprehensive, platform-specific, and accessible directly from the CLI where appropriate (e.g., `/privacy`, `/pricing` commands).
