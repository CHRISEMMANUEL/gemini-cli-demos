    *   These issues report problems with authentication, including failures to log in, issues with API keys, problems with Google Workspace accounts, and authentication errors in specific environments. It also includes problems that are due to external resources not being accessible by the user for some reason or another and therefore being unable to authenticate. Finally, issues with .env loading could be grouped here also.
    *   Course of Action: Create a meta-issue for authentication, linking to all these issues. Investigate and address the root causes of these authentication problems, including clarifying documentation and improving error handling.


*   **Group 2: Rate Limiting and Model Switching Issues**

    *   I_kwDOObWEYM69u3av: [The model switching by it self and running tokens and time](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2292)

    *   These issues focus on the Gemini CLI's automatic switching between "pro" and "flash" models due to rate limiting and the related problems such as endless loops, error messages, and a reduction of code quality in some cases.
    *   Course of Action:  Create a meta-issue for rate limiting and model selection/switching. Provide more granular control over model selection (e.g., a way to disable the automatic switch, or a command to manually switch models), better error reporting, and clearer communication of rate limits and usage.
