## LLM-Driven Course of Action

Upon reviewing the collected data, particularly the GitHub issues, a recurring theme around **'Rate Limiting' and 'Quota Exceeded'** has been identified. This suggests a significant pain point for users, as evidenced by issues like:

*   [Issue 1502: gemini-2.5-pro is [API Error: got status: 429 Too Many Requests.](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1502)
*   [Issue 1671: Rate limiting detected loop](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/1671)
*   [Issue 2336: I didn't use much, and the error quota was used up](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2336)

**Proposed Actions:**

1.  **Consolidate and Prioritize**: These issues appear to be direct duplicates or closely related manifestations of the same underlying problem. It is highly recommended to:
    *   **Designate a primary issue**: Issue 1502 seems to be a good candidate as it directly mentions the API error code (429).
    *   **Close duplicates**: Close Issue 1671 and Issue 2336 as duplicates of Issue 1502, ensuring all relevant context and comments are transferred or linked. This will centralize discussion and tracking.
2.  **Engineering Investigation**: This recurring problem indicates a need for immediate engineering attention.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate why users are frequently hitting rate limits. Is it due to aggressive retry logic, insufficient default quotas, or unexpected usage patterns?
    *   **User Experience Improvement**: Implement clearer error messages and guidance within the CLI when rate limits are encountered. Provide users with actionable steps (e.g., "You've hit your quota. Please wait X minutes or consider upgrading your plan.").
    *   **Automatic Backoff/Retry**: Ensure the CLI implements robust exponential backoff and retry mechanisms to gracefully handle temporary rate limits without user intervention or confusing error loops.
3.  **Documentation Update**: 
    *   **Quota Management**: Clearly document API quotas and how users can monitor their usage or request increases.
    *   **Best Practices**: Provide guidance on how to use the CLI efficiently to avoid hitting rate limits.

This proactive approach will significantly improve user satisfaction and reduce the volume of similar bug reports.
