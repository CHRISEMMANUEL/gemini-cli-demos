Please help me generate a Google Slides which contains 1-2 slides with this repos intent, and then 1 slide PER demo folder.

**Note**. Because of the folder cage, this can't be run within its canonical folder, but from the git ROOT repo :/ (or you do a symlink..)

**Note**. Oh wait, I fixed this with `ln -s ../../ gemini-cli-demos-symlink` which I conveniently added to justfile. So whenever you need to read files in `../../`, just ask me to execute the proper `just escape-the-cage` command ;)

## Slides content

All slides should have fun, colorful things, and emojis.

Slide 1:
* title: Gemini CLI Demos
* subtitle: Welcome to the newest Gemini CLI debut!

Slide 2:
* title: Repository Intent
* rest of the slide: explain what this repo is for and offer a list/table of demos.

Slide 3-(N+2)
* title: ${DemoName[N]}
* subtitile: by {NameSurname[N]}
* bulletpoints: highlighting what it does
* Needs to have an image from the repo.

Slide LAST:

3. Title: "Thank you!"
4. Subtitle: "Generated by gemini-cli + auto-slide-creator"

## Images

Add images for each slide. Take the best picture you identify per folder (if any). Any png in that folder works. If picture is not found, use logo.png under assets/.

## Formatting

* Backticks should become monofont dark-green words.
* Asterisks (*) should of course become Slides bullet points.
* Same for bold/italic: any markdown should be transformed in proper HTML-like rendering for Slides. Make bold to be blue (google logo blue).


## Images
Store images on Google Drive or GCS, whichever.
Even better: don't store them and add them directly inside the slide object.

If all else fails, use this image by the author: https://sessionize.com/image/71b5-400o400o2-WrWArqkGzSaKjoMzfViDU.jpg
