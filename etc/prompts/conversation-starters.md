This is a collection of prompts that works for me. Feel free to take and use!

## New day, where were we again? #git

Use this when you were in the middle of something but you got sidetracked and forgot what was this about.

Prompt:

```
Yesterday I went to sleep and you and I were in the middle of something.
Please use git diff for current changes (or git diff with latest change) to understand what we were doing.

* Did you complete the task at hand?
    * If NOT, propose a plan to complete it (and complete after I confirm the plan).
    *  If yes, is there anything missing in your opinion? For instance, did you bump version, changelog, and is documentation on par with the new feature/task/bugfix? Is there a GitHub issue we need to udpate/complete?

```
