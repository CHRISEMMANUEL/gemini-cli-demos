## CI/CD

We moved to LLM-Ops Gemini-based ci/cd, see for instance: `just update-readme`

```bash
$ gemini -a -p "Update README with [possibly new] articles under demos/"
I will update the main `README.md` to include the demos I found in the `demos/` directory. First, I'll list the contents of the `demos/` directory to identify all the demos. Then, for each demo, I will read its `STATUS.md` file to gather the necessary information to update the main `README.md`.
```

## CONTRIBUTING

Please do contribute to this repo. Add a new folder and make sure it's complete with:
- purpose
- repeatable code
- tests.

Every folder should have:

1. A `GEMINI.md` which shows users (and Gemini!) the purpose of what you're trying to build.
2. A `SCRIPT.md` , this is a README you're going to read if recording a video, basically.
3. A `README.md` which teases users on what this is about. This is linked from main README, so make it nice, engaging,
   short and full of images/screenshots which show the art of possible.
