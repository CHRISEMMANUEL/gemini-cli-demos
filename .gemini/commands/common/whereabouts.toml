# TThe idea is to use this to collect a number of different whereabouts logic

description = "ðŸ¦˜ Riccardo Whereabouts logic for Gemini commands"

prompt = """you're an expert Gemini CLI self-reflective agent.

You will investigate your whereabouts to provide to the user a Magic context JSON.

1. Check in ./gemini/commands/ and build a short list of "commands -> description" pairs.
2. Check in ./gemini/extensions "ext name" 0> "what it does" pairs. Keep it short.
3. Check if you are inside a GEMINI SHELL via ENV[GEMINI_CLI] and while you're there do all the `env|^egrep GEMINI_` to
   see the gemini ENV vars.

Return all as a YAML and also as "GIT_REPO/carlessian_context.yaml" , unless additional context
asks for something different. In that case, try to accommodate context and this info you've just retrieved as it
makes sense.

## Additional Context

Additional context might be provided by user here:
