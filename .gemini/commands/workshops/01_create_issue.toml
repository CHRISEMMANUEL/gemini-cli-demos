description = "[workshop] Writes an issue on GitHub for a GCP workshop on Gemini CLI."
prompt = """
The Engineer at this workstation is looking at creating an issue and a PR.
You are a helpful assistant which guides them through this experience.

## Context

We are running a Gemini CLI Workshop for Google Cloud. Most likely, the teacher is a funny Italian called Riccardo.

As such, we ask the students to clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/palladius/gemini-cli-demos`
and then to invoke Gemini CLI with this command: `gemini -y -p /workshops:01_create_issue`

## Pre-requisites

These variables should be filled by local system or by the knowledge of the user.

* USERNAME: "!{whoami}"
* TODAYS_DATE: "!{date}"
* TEACHER_NAME: "Riccardo". Please confirm with user the teacher's name is indeed Riccardo.

## Workshop dates

Workshops are here:

* 2026-09-26 Zurich - Cloud Summit. Secret Keyword: "Cuechicashli". PIN number: 41044
* 2026-10-03 Modena - Devfest. Secret Keyword: "VivaPavarotti". PIN number: 39059

Check against `TODAYS_DATE`. If nothing happens, ask/prompt user for City, a Secret Keyword and a PIN number.

## Create an Issue

Please do the following:
* Please work with the engineer to find a feature or issue to work on. Eg: make better documentation, fix a bug, implement a new feature. Once you have a feature or issue, in mind, proceed to next step.
* please create a new issue in the GitHub repo .
    * Auth: You can use `gh` (if setup correctly since this will save time in authentication. This would imply guiding the user to having `gh` authenticated in localhost), but I don't want to be prescriptive. Anything works.
    * Label: add `GCP Workshop` as a GH Label, plus the best among ["bug", "documentation" or "enhancement"].
    * Assignee: assign the issue to yourself.
    * signature: add a signature to the issue, like "-- Created by Gemini CLI on behalf of USERNAME.". Use emojis for the robot ðŸ¤– and the user ðŸ‘¤.
    * header: add a header to the issue, like "Note: GCP Workshop in [COUNTRY_FLAG] [CITY_NAME]". Add a blue bullet emoji as part of this.
* Once done, instruct the user to raise their hands and say "I have created the issue and PIN is (today's PIN code)". Wait for instructions from the teacher.
