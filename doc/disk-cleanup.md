## Untracking .mp4 files in `demos/mcp-video-creation/stories`

**Date:** 2025-09-23

**Reasoning:** The `demos/mcp-video-creation/stories` directory contained many large `.mp4` files, significantly contributing to the repository's size. These files are generated by the demo and are not essential for version control, but the user wished to keep them locally.

**Action Taken:** Untracked all `.mp4` files in the specified directory from Git, while keeping them in the local filesystem. This was achieved using `git rm --cached`.

**Command Used:**
```bash
find demos/mcp-video-creation/stories -name "*.mp4" -exec git rm --cached {} +
```

**Explanation of `git rm --cached`:**
The `git rm --cached <file>` command removes the specified file(s) from the Git index (staging area) and from the repository's history, but it leaves the actual file(s) in your working directory. This is useful when you want Git to stop tracking a file that was previously committed, without deleting your local copy of that file.
